I've been teaching for the past 5 five years, I don't love the job and I don't hate the job. I always knew teaching in public education would not be my forever job. I'm getting my Masters in instructional design and am actually doing an internship in that field at the moment. 

My problem (and source of major anxiety) is that the summer is almost over and I'm absolutely dreading going back to teaching. The school I'm at is very toxic and I feel like I have no personal life during the school year because I'm too tired to do anything. I also make more money as an intern than I do as a teacher. 

I've been applying and interviewing for an ID job but haven't landed anything yet. I also know that many businesses don't necessarily work on an expedited timeline when hiring. My only thought is to start teaching in the fall, keep applying, and breaking my contract when I finally do find a new job. 

Not sure if I'm wanting advice or just needed to vent (I don't have many people I can talk to about this).

This of course has its own challenges, but I am dealing with them relatively well as my background is in chemistry. 

The school, understandably struggles with resources and staff due to its location 60 km away from a war zone. As such the middle years program was missing an English teacher for the first 3 grades (i.e. 6th-8th grade, ages 11-14). Therefore I volunteered to teach English to one of the grades. I am not qualified to teach English but thought that having a teacher would be better than not having a teacher at all. Hopefully this should be a temporary fix (anyone wanna teach English in Kurdistan?). I started this week and have begun to realise what an undertaking this is!

If anyone has any advice/resources on classroom and behavioral management as well as teaching English for the IB middle years program, I would be very grateful to receive them.

I work at an alternative school in Oklahoma that houses students for a set number of days who would otherwise be on long-term suspension. 

This place is a tough environment. I know that, and I expect that. I've been cussed at and threatened more times than I can count.  Honestly though, the kids are, by and large, great. I just can't deal with an administration that won't support me when I specifically ask for it. 

In the past few days, I've written up two students that i feel don't need to be in my class for a couple of days. The first one cussed me out in front of other students, and this isn't the first time I've had to send him out of class. I'm not real thrilled that he's back rather than being in ISD, but I wasn't going to throw a fit about it either. 

The second student, however, is a different story. Today at lunch, the conversation my students were having steered in the direction of one of them being called gay as an insult. Now, that particular student is straight and isn't thin-skinned, but I sternly told my students to change the subject. Instead, another student chose to call that student a fag. I absolutely do not tolerate hate speech in my class. I sent the offending student straight to the office, and the rest of us returned to class. That student was back in my class in five minutes. I went down to the office and respectfully disagreed with the decision to not send her to ISD, and I pointed out that the word she used was no different than calling somebody a racial slur. The teacher in charge of discipline argued that it wasn't, and the principal agreed that nothing else should be done other than the student's parents be called. He gave the old, ""we'll hammer down next time"" speech and called it a day. 

Now, I understand that kids will be kids, and I've said as many off-color things as the next guy, but as a teacher, I can't sit by and say that it's not a big deal to use homophobic slurs. Especially not in school. I'm going to stick it out for the rest of the semester, but I don't get paid enough to start fudging my principles. Not for 33k a year for damn sure.

There is a little boy in my class who I learned lives in a shelter. When morning snack is over I typically save the extras for him to take home. Well one day this week a little girl got annoyed and said ""Why can't I take it home?"" I asked her if she had food at home, she said yes. I said if I have enough you can happily have some too but some people aren't as lucky as you in that way. We had a long talk about it and I reminded her we are a team and we look out for each other.  She walked over to the little boy and asked if he was taking it home for his siblings. The boy told her that sometimes his mom doesn't have much food for dinner so he brings this home to his siblings. She looked back at me teary eyed and got in line. Flash forward to today, we are eating breakfast. The little girl walks up and asks for a baggy for her extra apples. I give it to her thinking she is bringing it home. She bags it up and walks over to the little boy and goes ""here ***** bring this home to your family, I am full but you can have these."" The little boy teared up and hugged the girl.

I've decided to change my ways and have been on the path to conquer those emotions. It was my desperation that led me to develop School Your Brain, a website for struggling teachers. Really it was a website designed just for me. 

I am somewhat of an introvert and facing my students everyday was a challenge in and of itself. There were days that I wanted to just crawl under a rock. Embarrassingly enough, I had some low points where I would call out of work just to avoid seeing my students. 

I am not saying that this feeling has disappeared, but I learned how to train my mind to be mentally tough, mentally prepared for the psychological warfare that goes on in my classroom. 

To get an idea of what I am talking about visit http://www.schoolyourbrain.com/the-audio-tapes/
to get an idea of how I can help.

I am having the best time with my students now, not because they have changed, but because I have changed my mindset as a teacher. If you have ever felt this way and need someone to help out check out the site. I truly believe it could be beneficial to many teachers. 

Teaching is--no doubt--one of the toughest jobs in the world. So don't leave it to chance, do something about it, before the job swallows you whole.

However, this year I just feel like my classroom mojo is off. I feel like in the past I was very open and inclusive in my classroom. I tried very hard to really make every student feel valued and did a lot of on the spot inquiry and a lot of great lessons that came about from constructing my classroom by combining student interest with content. 

However, this year is just so so baffling. The classes just seem to get out of control if I allow them two inches of autonomy. Transitions SUCK. Partner/classroom discussion is non existent because no one stays on topic and when we are sharing as a class, it takes the first person to get 2 sentences into their response for the rest of the class to start commenting and getting off track. Its just so incredibly disheartening because its just seems like I am so limited in how I teach. Even more so, I have a few students that just WILL. NOT. STOP. TALKING. Its just a stream of bad behavior. I try ignoring it, it gets worse. I try punishment, nada. I'm at the end of my rope here. Today I tried to be more inclusive and I brought the student up to the board with me to answer questions. It was magical. He focused, he learned. He went back to his seat and went fucking wild again. 

Any experience teacher out there have any particularly helpful strategies to her curve attention needy class clowns &amp; the uncontrollable blurters?

Awesome!  Student teaching in the high school gave me both the experience and the confidence that I needed to get out there and start teaching.  Lo and behold, I actually managed to land a job- at a middle school- which I am technically certified to teach at, but had no experience with.
The position started in mid-January, and I quit in early February.  It only took three weeks for the job to absolutely crush my spirit.  In those three weeks, I lost 10 pounds, and I was constantly sick, angry, and/or depressed.  I knew when I accepted the position that it was going to be more challenging than starting fresh at the beginning of the year, but I had no idea what I was really walking into.  I didn't know that the class had not had a permanent teacher since September.  I didn't know everything was chaos.  I didn't know every moment was going to be an uphill battle, with students and parents alike.
Admin was understanding when I resigned, but I am still so disappointed in myself.  I've never been a quitter before.  I left student teaching feeling like I was absolutely on the right track, and now I'm not sure if I ever want to step into a classroom again.

Just wondering if any of you have worked with the SABIS school system? I am considering a position (6th grade ELA) at a SABIS school, and I know literally nothing about it or the curriculum they use, other than the crash course sort of things I just researched today. I've only ever taught in public schools that used CCSS or similar, so I would love to know what real teachers' takes on it are! :) 

So thoughts--for real. Advantages/disadvantages? Likes/dislikes? Things to look out for? Comparison to CCSS or IB? How much flexibility do you have within the schools? Things like that! :)

First year teacher here! I need advice about sick days and wondering if I made the right decision. 
So I've already used 3/10 (today is 4) of my sick days and it's this close to the beginning of year so I'm nervous about that. But anyway, here's my scenario:

I was out Tuesday for being sick (rotating between bathroom and bed), came in Wednesday and pushed through nausea and felt about normal after about noon, but today I came in and once I was at school  called a sub because I couldn't move at all without being very nauseous. 

I gave the first hour kids a worksheet (not the original plan today) and waited for the sub to arrive while I sat at my desk and made notes for the sub. Despite being one of my better classes they were shouting and trying to play music on their phones (this is high school) and just not working in general, but I had no energy to shout or even stand up to stop them. I definitely could've made it through the day by just sitting at my desk silently after giving them a worksheet...but they would've been crazy. They're already crazy every day (that's another story...inner city school and all that jazz), but today basically would've had to have been a day without rules. 

So did I make the right decision to go home? Would that have hurt my classroom management even more to basically just suspend all rules due to me being sick...they'll basically have no rules with the sub...but at least I won't be sitting there doing nothing about it?

I don't know..I'm just frustrated because it seems like most teachers only miss when they're practically dying and I've already missed even when it wasn't that bad and if this were just a desk job I'd have been able to push through it.

At the beginning of the year, I had an emotional breakdown with my director and she said that if I felt as though I can't stay in the district for next year, she will help me find a new job.

Right now what I am struggling with is what will happen if I don't get a job next year. I want to talk to the director about leaving and having her be a reference and write me a letter of recommendation, but that means I won't have a secure job for next year.

What should I do? Should I just not tell her and get colleagues to write letters of recommendation and be references or should I talk to my director about it?

I feel like I'm connecting with the students (most of them) and I get a lot of joy out of being around them. They're middle schoolers and I'm an English teacher, btw. But GOD, jesus tap dancing christ, this is such a difficult job. There's so much pressure from our higher ups due to our school's low standardized test performance. I constantly feel like I'm under the microscope, under the gun, like I'm going to lose my job. We've had numerous teachers quit this year already! I have people from central office coming into my classroom all the time, people breathing down my neck, so many requirements, so much pointless paperwork, so many pointless meetings. I feel like this job is impossible. Im-fucking-possible. The entropy and bureaucracy is overwhelming. Every spare second of my schedule gets crammed with something. I blink my eyes and it's the end of the day, and there are a dozen to-do list items I didn't get to. I need to live my life, too, and I feel like I can't do that and do everything I need to do to stay on top of my job. If I did everything I needed to do, like contact all my kids' parents who are failing or have behavior problems or aren't turning in their homework, or if I prepare all the makeup packets for the chronic absentees, etc, etc, then I'd be working like 70 hours a week, and who the fuck works 70 hours a week for 40K. I'd get fat and lose my hair and no job is worth that. I'm not a fucking martyr. Plus the parents of our worst kids are gang bangers, and I'm afraid to confront them. They're hostile as fuck. It's a nightmare.

I'm doing this because it's supposed to be a good job, not an impossible one that makes me feel like shit. I'm just talking about the nature of the job itself. The students are another matter.

I'm sorry, I know you're going to think I'm an asshole and I probably don't belong in education, but hear me out - our kids are fucking horrible. HORRIBLE. It just has to be said. Yeah, I know about their poverty and my heart bleeds, yada yada yada, but seriously a lot of them are just fucking terrible little humans. They're going to wind up committing crimes and right now it's like watching the train wreck in slow motion before it fully explodes. I goofed off as a student in middle school, but not like this. Their behavior goes WAAAY beyond what is even remotely close to acceptable. They seriously have zero respect for themselves, one another, or their teachers. They're crazy, and it's driving me crazy. It's like they're dragging me down to their level. I'm generally a happy, carefree, laid back guy. I don't know what the hell I got myself into. I don't know what it takes to survive this, but maybe I don't have it after all. I get praise, and I feel okay about the job most of the time, but something snapped last night and this morning, and that's why I'm venting.

I keep asking myself more and more lately, why the hell did I do this to myself? I switched careers for this, and now I'm starting to regret it big time. I was talking with coworkers recently, and all we did was vent. I took a step back from the conversation in my mind and realized this isn't normal or healthy. We talk about our jobs like we have PTSD. I was bored to death in my old office job, but now I feel like I'm in a war zone. The noise and negativity of this school is so fucking difficult on a day to day basis. Fighting all the time. Kids slinging slurs at one another. No one doing any work. Hardly anyone at grade level.

Someone warned me this school could tank my career, and I'm starting to think they're right. But what else can I do? I have an M.Ed. What the hell else do you do with that? I took out loans, too, and I'm in debt for it. I'm such a fucking idiot.

Financially speaking, teaching has got to be the dumbest fucking career choice. I'm working my ass off, getting stressed out, going insane from the chaos and negativity, and then on occasion there are cupcakes in the break room, like okay, let's all get diabetes too.

Basically the kids start out by doing homework. When they’re done, they need to work on an educational activity or read a book. This whole part takes an hour.

Then it’s snack time (30 mins) and the snacks are supply by my employers. After that, the kids do another activity (doesn’t always have to be educational, but they’d prefer that it is most of the time).  I have a few ideas already, but am open to suggestions. This should cover an hour.

The rest of the day is simple; gym time for 30 minutes, and then computer time until their parents pick them up (about 30 mins).

The only concern I have is they want all the kids do the same activity. I don’t want anything too simple for the older kids and over the heads of the younger kids.

I'm a raider from the galactic accounting department. I know nothing about the teaching profession, except for having been on the receiving end, as it were. I do know a little bit about business process improvement,* and I'm wondering if what the accounting world knows could make your lives a bit easier. 

I was talking with an elementary school teacher the other day. She was frustrated with her curriculum and started asking her students meta-questions to gauge how well she was doing. The answer: terrible. This is a good thing, because now she knows there's a problem and can correct it. She did this before a graded assignment, and got a lot more information from it. 

This leads me to two questions: 

1. From the outside (having recently escaped college), the industry looks bloated, tired, running on an ineffective treadmill making the same mistakes over and over again. This may or may not be justified, so I'd like to hear from anyone closer to the action. Has anyone ever tried applying lean manufacturing techniques* to education?

2. Teachers have a better grasp of what their classroom needs than distant textbook authors, granted. I did some cursory googling and found resources for elementary teachers that look like they were designed for elementary students. Is there a resource more like a GitHub for education: where teachers can share insights, techniques, and anecdotes freely?

2b. If some entrepreneur made one, would anyone use it?

Today, student A brought student B into my room at the start of the period because B was having an anxiety attack. I sat with the kids in a quiet location while my class did their work. I’d never met or seen B before, but the anxiety was real and bad. 

After I called counselors and admin who came in to help, B was taken care of and parents were notified, I spent some time with A, who was very shaken. A said she brought B to my room because “this is a safe place and I knew you would help.” I didn’t feel like I did much other than being calm and reassuring and a trustworthy adult. 

But this was one of those moments that really shook me. I wanted to be if so much more help than I felt like I was. This afternoon and evening, I’ve been tense and snippy with my husband, and to a lesser degree, with my own children. I realized I was dealing with some anxiety about the situation and I’m doing my best to work through it. What bothers me most, though, is that B sat through a full half hour period of time in a classroom where no one recognized how upset and afraid he was, and it would have been hard to miss his distress based on his behavior in my room. I’m so sad and angry that his needs weren’t being met during that time. I’m going to talk to the admin who was present for everything as well as the counselor to follow up, and they did an amazing job, but I’m still wrestling with the stress of it all. Tips for managing anxiety in my students and for myself would be very much welcome and appreciated.

Before January, I was employed at this facility as a student worker. I’m coming in on my 4th school year with these kids, and I am now in a preschool room covering another teacher’s maternity leave. 

My classroom has a head teacher and a supervising teacher, then there’s me. I LOVE my kids, and it is a joy seeing them everyday, but I come home and cry almost every night because of the way that I am treated in the classroom. The two other teachers that I work with are extremely unwelcoming. I am far beyond uncomfortable in my own class, because I genuinely feel like I have a target on my back. 

I am at a loss. I know that I am not a bad teacher. Kids love me, and most other coworkers enjoy working with me. Nevertheless, I walk in every day feeling like I can’t do anything right. In my four years here, I have NEVER had an experience like this. My co-teachers are bossy, disrespectful, and I can tell that they think very highly of themselves. My guess is that they still view me and treat me as a student, even though I have a teaching degree and could very well apply for and potentially get a “real teaching job” if there were any open in my area right now. 

Context: The head teacher in my room pulled me aside for an unwarranted performance review. She rattled off a list of things I need to do better, all of which she provided examples for. The things she mentioned have happened once or twice in the past month of my working there. For example, she mentioned that I “Really need to match my actions to my words.” Because she saw me talk to a kid about running on concrete, but I was “dancing around with her”, so I wasn’t being firm. I had actually just helped the child off the ground, and was just beginning to talk to her about being safe when the head teacher pulled the child away from me and gave her a stern talking-to herself. 

The head teacher also mentioned that I shouldn’t talk so much about myself, because then the conversations that I have with kids are all about me. This is a “suggestion” that really offended me, because when I do talk about myself, I am answering questions that kids have about me or my life. The kids do not know me nearly as well as they know either of the other teachers, and are curious about who I am and what I do. I feel that I am creating positive relationships with these children, but she apparently feels that I am a self-centered chatter bug. 

The last point the teacher made was that I am “always late” because I wash my hand in the classroom sink when I come in, so I start “working” roughly 1 minute after I’m supposed to. What bugs me is that she and the other teacher consistently take LONG lunches, and don’t release me until 5-10 minutes in to my designated lunch break time slot. They also hang out and talk/laugh in their office while I supervise the children throughout their entire nap time...but I’m not supposed to say anything about that because I’m just an associate teacher.

How in the world do I navigate this? I want to respect my co-teachers, and I want them to respect me, but I genuinely feel that I can not be myself in their classroom because I feel so uncomfortable. I know that it affects my teaching. I am much less personable and enthusiastic when they are criticizing me. They have driven other teachers to quit with this same behavior, and I don’t want that to happen to me. I just can’t get over it. 

Any tips? Please?",,7xo4cp,,0,,false,1520539198,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7xo4cp/coteaching_woes/,,,,,

I teach 8th-grade science in NYC. My classes went better than usual but the end of the day ruined everything. I had kids yelling at each other when they packed up their stuff to go, there was rampant disrespect and kids doing just whatever the hell they wanted. It was chaos. 4 sixth graders held up the entire 8th grade when we were trying to get down the stairs to dismiss just because they decided not to move and screamed about it. Then I stepped in dog shit at dismissal and went back upstairs to grade terrible homework responses.

But then I got an email from a kid to whom I recommended my favorite book of all time and who has since decided to read the series. She essentially told me that the book had gotten her through a really tough time and has helped her become more confident in the classes that she struggles in. She insinuated that the book has gotten her out of a bit of a depression and has helped her feel more adventurous and happy with herself. 

I'm a 24-year-old guy and I just wept at my computer. This job can be rough, but those little moments make it all worth it.

Today at school we had a non-instructional day due to a field trip. My school is very lenient when it comes to showing some movies on days like these. Well, on Netflix, I found the movie ""Little Monsters"" with Fred Savage in it (was made in the 1980s), and I remember watching this as a kid like 20 years ago on TV, so I thought the students would enjoy it. This movie was in the KIDS section of Netflix and I never use any other profile but this. 

About halfway through the movie, the word ""hell"" was used (as in, What the hell are you doing?), and I thought maybe that was just a small fluke. Then, in another scene, the word piss was used, at which point I immediately stopped the movie. The students were actually really enjoying the movie and wanted to continue, but I told them that because the P word was used, I could not justify continuing this movie because I was afraid there might be more surprise language later. I apologized and made it clear to the students that I had NO IDEA that words like that would be used in a movie found in the KIDS account on Netflix and I didn't want their parents to think I was showing them inappropriate things. So I decided to pick something else for us to watch. I did go home later and watch the rest of the movie. I soon found out I was right about more surprise language (it used bitch and shit as well, but the students didn't see those scenes because it was way later). I opened a chat with Netflix customer service at home and reported the movie as inappropriate for the KIDS section of Netflix. 

I guess right now I'm a little worried that a parent might call the school and my principal will have me in his office with questions. I swear this is an honest mistake, and I am so afraid I'm going to get in trouble. I had Netflix send me the chat logs so that in case I do end up in the principal's office, I can have proof that I made it a point to report this movie and maybe it can be used as evidence that it really and truly was an honest mistake. The customer service rep I chatted with agreed with me that content like that shouldn't be in a KIDS section of Netflix and she also submitted a report. Honestly, the other two 6th grade teachers and I use the KIDS section of Netflix all the time and not a single time has there ever been an issue with any of its content until today.",,7dq9ds,,0,,false,1512273112,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7dq9ds/a_little_worried/,,,,,

I know it's that time of year for all of us. Sending love and power and peaceful thoughts.

I'm trying to figure out how I can fight the very serious burnout that's been knocking me down since Thanksgiving break. 

I'm a first year special ed teacher (trained to teach French, but I'll go where I'm needed / where the jobs are) at a Title 1 charter in turnaround mode. Most of my kids deal with mental health issues as well as LDs, and almost all have trauma histories associated with gang violence and ICE raids. My school has extremely rigorous academics and a very strict (I'd say draconian, but I signed up for it, I guess) behavior system. Special ed gets forgotten a lot, and I feel like the rest of the school sees us as a burden.

The kids have 9 hour days (7 to 4), not counting detention and tutoring. I haven't had a day shorter than 11 hours since week 6. Our principal regularly makes us stay later for meetings, where he berates us for classroom cleanliness and taking too many sick days. He is trying his best in a really tough situation, but his negativity brings down my morale at the very least.

I love my kids and the work I do, but I am so tired all the time. My physical and mental health are a disaster (constantly feeling suicidal, having to take the max dose of my anxiety meds every day, IBS, chronic aches and migraines). I want to take care of myself, but when I get home at 8pm and have to be up at 5, there is no time to do that.

I'm trying to hold on until winter break, but the idea of coming back in the new year makes me want to die. I don't want to abandon my kids, because it's happened to them so many times in their lives, but my life and well being are important, too. I feel weak, lazy, selfish, and incapable every day.

Anyone else going through similar feelings? Any advice. I am so on the edge it's not even funny. My coworker has already had to be hospitalized twice for stress. I can't imagine how this could possibly be sustainable for anyone without an iron constitution.

Thank you for listening. I just need to get it out there because I don't feel like anyone at work wants to hear my complaining.",,7i6n1t,,0,,false,1515298905,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7i6n1t/fighting_burnout/,,,,,

I made a decision to make a career change this year and after working in tech for many years, I got my alternative teaching certification in Texas and am looking to start at a highschool teaching social studies. 

As of last week, and revising my resume and cover letters several times, I have started applying at schools. I'm not getting anything back unfortunately, and with the clock ticking down, I am starting to wonder what I can do. I have zero years experience and from what I've started finding out, it seems to be pretty competitive here in Austin. That is to say, there is no reason for a school to hire me (no experience, ""intern"" year) over someone with years experience and maybe even an actual degree. 

Did I make a huge mistake in getting my social studies certification? Should I get my science certification asap? Will a principal hire me without my science cert if I start applying for those positions (with the earliest I can take that cert being the 24th of August)",,6swqsk,,0,,false,1504667425,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/6swqsk/how_do_i_get_hired/,,,,,

Ideas?,"My wife is a teacher in a difficult urban high school where the student culture is largely to talk over her, laugh and joke loudly, play music on cell phones, etc. In order to have even a chance to be heard, she must speak very loudly all day. (She's also very stressed)

I've noticed lately she is having problems with her voice. She clears her throat now every 30 seconds (*never* did this before this job this year), and today she barely can talk and is just taking the evening off from talking to me for that.

Any experience with this? Options? I was thinking about using a mic and speaker system, though I'm not sure how that will work since these students tend to destroy equipment left there and there is no good place to lock it up and I wouldn't want her carrying anything further. Maybe we can work out something.

We have taught before at the college level and although I myself noticed some very minor soreness (not as bad as she has) for about the first week of lecturing, it always would go away as my voice got ""into shape"". So *some* of this may be due to her having almost two weeks off for the holiday break and she's gotten a bit vocally out of shape, but I'm looking for ways where she can cut down on all the shouting. It can't be good for her voice in the long term, and it's no fun even if it is ""only"" 2-3 times a year that she goes through this.

Thanks.

Each of my five years I’ve been in the same school but with a different admin. I’ve never had trouble with any of them before but this years admin is the worst. She told a family that an IEP doesn’t entitle the student to attend school because he’s in preschool. She purposely keeps the gross motor balls deflated so they don’t bounce too high and break the lights. I love my current district but just can’t work for someone who has no idea what they’re doing anymore. FWIW, I’m willing to take a small pay cut to be happy but many area districts pay close to $10K less than what I currently make and I can’t swing a pay cut that large. 

Anyway, I started looking for new jobs. One school called me for an interview even though I hadn’t even submitted their application yet. I interviewed and they’re calling my references. I’m going to assume they will offer me the job. The job is 35 min away in a well paying district but the position involves case managing a large number of IEPs (admin was upfront about this in the interview). They also said they want to open up other resource type classrooms (what I teach now) if they are given more funding (likely). Should I take the job now or wait until more jobs are posted and I might find one that’s a better fit? Not to sound cocky but I’ve done a lot of work in education outside if my classroom and have a pretty good resume. How do I tell my current district I’m leaving? If offered the new position can I ask to think about it for a few days? Can I accept the new position in the new district but then apply for other jobs within that district that may be a better fit once those are posted?

I was a young 21, terrified, stressed out, losing my voice every term and opted not to continue in teaching at the end of the year as teaching 'wasn't for me' although I think I was really stressed out of my mind due to imposter syndrome and a mortal fear of being observed. 

Fast forward 15 years and I'm looking for a new career post a long layoff for medical reasons. Admittedly, due to severe depression. Teaching is one option of several. While I feel I'm certainly more mature and better able to ask for help from colleagues, I do have some anxieties I'm hoping you'll be able to allay.

1) How do you handle aspects of the curriculum where you have minimal experience/no talent? In my case, music. Do you teach yourself? Ask a colleague how to proceed? Take a course?

2) How do you cope when you're moved from one age group where you feel comfortable to one that seems alien? I taught P4 (7-8 year olds) and loved the age group. Any of the older classes would be fine. But nursery or P1 (pre-school/kindergarten) was the age range I never 'got the hang of' in teacher training and I'd be afraid to be made to teach it.

I know you all probably read posts like this all the time but I want to reach out to as many teachers and educators in general as possible for some help.

I'm a first year teacher in a new state in which I don't know anyone and I am seriously considering quitting my job as a sophomore World History teacher. My school is in a low socioecomonic area which I am not used to and my particular grade of students seems to give the school in general the most problems. We have had an increase in fights, drugs, and school wide cyber bullying. Even with all this, generally the students and the administration are good.

My mentor teacher is helpful and my admin cares about how I'm doing. However, there is too much on all of our plates so that it is hard for them to give me the help I really need when it comes to classroom management. The only real consequence I can give a student is In School Suspension which I absolutely hate doing. So I've been way too lenient in class and am losing control.

Even with all that, I could stay and learn to be better but the real issue is that I have been getting intense panic attacks and everyday leaves me more and more burnt out. I try to take days off and recuperate, but in general I never feel okay. The weight of the responsibilities of a teacher along with the fact that most of these students care very little for school in general, much less for a history class leaves a pit in my chest that never feels quite okay. My school doesn't even make the students take history their Freshmen year and there are no honors classes. Just regular and A.P. which means that the students don't take the regular class seriously and think that history is the least important class in their 8 period day.

The students are lazy and disrespectful. I don't have the passion any more because of the burn out and I've gone through several cycles of intense anxiety to just moderate in the past couple of months. If I'm being honest, the only reason I haven't quit is because I would feel bad letting down the administration. I truly feel the kids would be okay because I can't keep them in line or get them to do their work anyway.

Basically, I feel ill-equipped mentally and emotionally to manage high school students and feel like my health is diminishing rapidly even though the school is not nearly as bad as the ones I've read about in other posts. I want to hear reasons why I should stay to help me make it through the year.

I'm currently estimated to graduate in December 2019. Since I'll most likely be graduating in the hiring off-season, I need to figure out what my best option is in terms of work until I can find a real job. 

Of course I'll be looking for long-term work in the midst of everything, but I'm not banking on finding anything. I'm determined to move out of my family's house upon graduation, so being able to have work that will allow me to support myself is important. 

I don't think it would be possible for me to support myself on subbing alone. It seems like the nature of being a sub is that you're on the wim of schools, and having a second job isn't much of an option. 

My other idea is to pick up a combination of waitressing, tutoring, and nannying. (I'm fortunate to live in an area where nannies and tutors get paid relatively well, $15+ an hour). I feel like this is the better option, since my primary goal is to be able to support myself. It's not ideal, but it could hold me over until hiring season. 

I've read that subbing is a fruitless job with bad pay and little chance to get your foot in the door since schools have multiple subs every day. Am I wrong?

I'm a High School teacher in Scotland, I teach Mathematics. I am strongly considering leaving the profession. I don't particularly enjoy it any more. The only thing that's keeping me going is that I get a steady, relatively good pay each month.

I used to love teaching. Up until a year ago I still did. But I've had various problems at home this year, including the death of my father and grandfather, and an ongoing battle with our local authority to ensure our autistic daughter is educated correctly (long story, but she's not).

I am getting so despondent with the sheer apathy of many of my pupils to their learning. A real unwillingness for the majority to take any kind of responsibility for their own learning. I try my best to make my lessons fun and engaging. I put on study support, Saturday classes, Easter school, you name it. I attend school social functions, I arrange trips, I (think, anyway!) have a reputation as being a decent, fair and kind teacher.

But I don't know how much longer I can go on. I'm sick of fighting stupid, silly behaviour from children who are seemingly given no kind of school-linked sanctions at home. I'm sick of fighting the scourge of mobile phones in school and the pictures regularly taken of staff and shared around Snapchat (of course, no-one knows who originally took the picture). My school's management team are great, but our local authority are a nightmare and push unrealistic targets on us.

I've been flirting with the idea of working from home. I do a bit of web design and development, and I enjoy private tuition (the drawback to private tuition is that it would be unsociable hours).

I've recently got my qualified status but have had a rocky start this year. My mentor has not provided much support at all. I've had to fight for a meeting with him, even weekly. We have no real relationship, he doesn't even come to check how I'm getting on or say hello. 
I get my ppa time taken off me at last minute a lot of the time, or extra kids put into my class with no warning, when other teachers are off. I can deal with that, it's just frustrating when nobody tells me it will happen! 

The advice I need is this though: I've been put on a support plan for a couple of aspects of teaching. This is fine, I've had little to no support all year so I'm glad I'm getting it now... Except I'm not. School won't/can't free me up to take time to observe or go to a nearby training school. I feel a bit helpless. I'm doing my best to work on the support plan on my own, but I need to speak to others. 
I have to stay here next year, it's part of my training course. But honestly, when I passed qts, I cried at the thought of that. (I had secretly hoped I'd fail so that I'd be free to leave!) 

I have spoken to my mentor, and my outside tutor has too. Everyone is aware of the situation with support, but it isn't changing. I don't know what else to do. 

Sorry for the rambling post. Even if nobody replies I think I just needed to get my thoughts written down.

2. The face they make when you tell them they will be having a Guest Teacher (substitute), and the hugs you get when you return.

I'm an Australian teacher in a low economic city area. I teach HS students (grades 7-12, roughly 12 to 18 year olds) and am going into my fourth year. Last year my HoD had me as shadow HoD to fill in for her duties when she was away. This year she's asked me to keep an eye on the two new hires we have who are fresh out of university and help them along.

I was wondering if I could get perspectives from other teachers on what they would find helpful being in their position; a new teacher, with no particular training towards the type of school they're in, fresh into the career.

I remember some of the things I had trouble with and had to learn the hard way, but hopefully other people can provide suggestions.

I'm Will Stanton and I'm trying to change the education paradigm globally. My team and I are nearing completion of the curriculum for a new model I created called the Six Dimension Model. Once finished, this curriculum will be available as a free download for both schools and homeschooling parents all around the world! The six dimensions of the model are Self-Discovery, Inquiry, Sustainability, Innovation, Communication, &amp; Empathy. Key areas in these dimensions include life skills, mindfulness, creative play, connecting with nature, philosophy and community (just to name a few). You can see the full vision for this paradigm shift in education at:
www.sixdimensionmodel.org

Now, my team and I need YOUR help. We just need five experts in the following fields to finish the curriculum:

- Design &amp; Technology
- Geography
- Quantum Physics
- Sex Education
- English as a Second Language

If you are or know of anyone in these areas who would want to voluntarily contribute to this amazing project, send me a private message or email: sixdimensionmodel@gmail.com

If you don't know anyone, please share this request anyway in your networks... would mean a lot to me.

So excited to see this all coming together... am anticipating its release as soon as this year!

Cheers
Will

I have one kid this year total Eeyore personality, always down about something, nothing is going to be good enough for mom who had to give up so much for him that the least he can do is get good grades. It hurt my heart to hear him say that at the beginning of the year so I always look out for him. Well today was a bad day. He walks in looking like he's about to cry, total hang dog. Apparently some kids were razzing him in the class before mine.

So we're going through a power point today and I tell him he's going to be my 'clicker'. The kids always compete to see who can flip through the slides, and you have to earn it. Only kids who are totally finished the notes can be the 'clickers'. Well I tell Eeyore that he's my 'clicker' today, he looks up at me with watery eyes and says that he doesn't deserve it, he hasn't finished. I whisper and grin that it doesn't matter because I make the rules, I'm still empress of my classroom (it's medieval history). 

By the end of class he's smiling and his whole demeanor is turned around. I know I can't always fix his problems and sometimes all I can do is listen.

I feel like I'm drowning. So the administration at my school doesn't assign class lists, the previous teachers do. Because of that I somehow ended up with 8 high behavior needs students. Most classes have 4 at the most.

When I say high behavior needs students I mean students who are runners, students who swear at me, students who rip things off my walls and vandalize my property, students who crawl under tables and won't come out. So I have that x8. 

First of all, I feel like I can't even teach. The goal isn't even academics in my classroom, it's just making sure everyone is safe. It's the second week of school and I'm still just reviewing routines and procedures because it's hard for students to get them down when I have a kid throwing books at my head.

Overall I was doing fine. I basically had the attitude of ""these were the cards I was given so I'm going to do what I can with it and if that means we can't get to academics when I'm supposed to, then that's proof I shouldn't have gotten dealt these cards."" That was until Friday, and then I realized that I'm basically drowning.

I was supposed to have an important meeting with my principal and administration during my prep. Right before my prep I had several meltdowns. So I had to deal with those and my mind was simply focused on that and making sure nobody loses a limb. I spent my prep writing 10 referrals.

I am an ""inclusion"" special education teacher for 6th grade, middle school.

Long story short I subbed last year at this middle school and at the request of many kiddos and a few teachers I came back as an ex ed (sped) teacher. We are expected to teach alongside the teacher of record while also managing a case load of students who are sld ( severe learning disabled).

One of my main problems have been that the teachers give me no power in the class. The ELA teacher today actually got into a confrontation with a student so bad that they were face to face yelling at each other. I had the child sit down at my table with me to do a refocus sheet but it was too late- the damage was done. The ELA teacher said she had to step out for a while and was in tears. As she left she told them all to write a three paragraph essay on the importance of safety. 

It doesn't get much better in my Math inclusion class where this teacher puts hands on hips and proceeds to lean into students faces and yell "" why can't you be quiet?!"" These are just the worst cases I have seen so far...

I have tried. Many other teachers have tried as well, to speak to them. I've tried to give them tips, new fun ways to re-direct, AVID strategies and PBIS refocus sheets. I've even been making seating charts for them to help them take attendance and manage behavior. I've been checking student's bellwork and logging grades and progress in my grade book as best I can in order to provide some sense of structure to the class but nothing I do seems to help.

The classes have no structure. Yesterday, the math teacher taught two problems. Two!!! All class period. The ELA teacher's assignment after bellwork? Get into groups and think of 10 problems... that's it. I've tried suggesting avid strategies but they don't like my lesson plans. At the same time they want to have me there to help with classroom management but they hesitate to let me teach a lesson. In ELA sometimes, the teacher yells at me when I'm trying to help a kid one on one!!! 

I realize that my grammar/ spelling must be atrocious, it's late at night and whatnot. I just really wish I could talk to someone who could help me do something to improve the class to assist the teacher while also protecting the children. I teach at a title 1 school and now when I come home I am starting to feel sick and physical pain over what I am seeing... I plan to email the principal and have spoken to some admin who are aware of the situation. My plan is to start just peacefully standing between the teacher and the student in order to stop the confrontation and protect the kids. This or the advice that I gain from my principal? Idk. Sorry for the length of this! I'm just hoping maybe someone on here can read and help me out...

1516479788,teaching,cara1123,self.teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/7rsu4n/student_teacher_issue/,74,31,,,Student Teacher Issue,"Hello all,
I am looking for feedback about an issue with student teachers I'm wondering if any other teachers are seeing.

I am in my eighth year of teaching English/Journalism at a large high school.  I work with a very talented department, and although I am certainly not the best English teacher in my school, I work very hard and have received accolades during my time there.  I also work well with people and hold several leadership positions in my school and district.

Our local university always asks teachers in our district to take on student teachers, and since I work at one of the four traditional high schools in the area, I always feel like we need to represent and take a few.  After nobody offered to take one this year (after a bad experience with one last year), I decided to have another go.  I had a great experience with a student teacher a few years ago, and I firmly believe it's important for veteran teachers to mentor newbies.  

I interviewed this person (they are 23; I'm 33) in May, and they seemed to be very confident.  I was very clear about expectations, and this person seemed to be 100% on board.  I also gave them some resources to study over the summer and all of our major texts to read.

In August, they came to every beginning of year inservices with me and started observing me the first day of school.  They met staff members and were treated well by all. They observed me three full days a week, and as the fall semester continued, I noticed they did not really seem very engaged or motivated.  They were there when they were supposed to be, but they never took notes or seemed motivated to get involved.  I brought their college observer (the mom of one of the best teachers in our department and 30-year veteran teacher) into the mix, and after she observed them a few times, we came up with a ""game plan"" on how to improve this person so they'd be ready to take over the classroom in January.

I have to add in at this point that the student teacher has a very awkward and closed personality and is not natural in the classroom.  This is the type of person who will say they are OK when they aren't because they think that's what you want to hear.  They are also the type of person that is afraid to ask questions and will not take chances.  In other words, this person isn't a natural in the classroom.  They did form some really strong bonds with students, and we worked on getting this person to open up to us about what they needed.  

Their observer and I gave so much feedback on lessons and really took time to help this person.  We did different activities to give them experience and really tried to capitalize on their skills.  Additionally, I have really great classes this year--small class sizes, wonderful students, and a good schedule.  There was so much support, and this person grew a lot in four months of observing and occasionally teaching.

Because the student teacher watched me for over four months, his observer and I decided to have them start off the semester.  We thought that because they often seemed complacent and even lazy, this might help motivate them.  We asked repeatedly if this was a good plan, and the student teacher confidentially answered yes each time.  I also came up with a curriculum plan for January, gave this person plenty of materials, and did some other things to prepare them.  Mind you, they already knew most of the students.  They seemed excited and almost relieved they were finally taking over the classroom.

Over winter break, I contacted the student teacher many times asking them if they were ready, and they always said yes.  On the first day of school, they did seem ready, but as the week continued, I noticed they seemed to fall back into that complacency.  They also seemed like they just didn't want to be there.  I figured that was because, as everyone knows, your first week of student teaching is stressful and hectic.  I repeatedly asked this person if they were OK or needed anything, and they said no.  I also helped out during lessons and interjected when needed, but I did not hover.  

Tuesday this week they came in and seemed to be fine but then did not come Wednesday and Thursday because they said they were ""sick.""  Yesterday they came in and said they needed to talk to me.  They said they felt they were overloaded and felt like they could not teach the classes I gave them.  I asked plenty of questions to get to the root of the problem, and I said I was confused as to how they felt overloaded as I've given them plenty of materials and they already saw me teach one of my semester classes once.  I also told them they weren't putting in enough time (this person usually gets to school after I do and leaves before I do).  They claimed they were working very hard at home, but they just felt like they couldn't catch up.  I was trying to be empathetic, so I told them I would take away one of their preps and then teach another class which repeats three times the first time so they could watch me.  I was going to put some extra supports in place to ensure their success.  This person did not seem satisfied with this arrangement, so after further questioning, they revealed to me they just aren't into teaching and hate it.  This was the first time I'd ever heard this from this person.  All along they told me how badly they wanted to teach and how excited they were.

After speaking with this person at length some more and trying to make them consider all sides of the issue (time and money spent in the education program, the fact that student teaching is difficult and everyone has tough weeks, etc.), I just sent them home because they were a mess and told them they needed to figure it out this weekend so I could plan ahead for Monday's classes if needed.  It didn't take them long to come to a conclusion--they emailed me last night and told me they plan on quitting.

I also called their education professor and let them know about the situation (this is before they decided they wanted to quit for sure).  She was shocked as this person spoke with her the day before, and although she was aware this person needed to back off a bit, they said everything was going great and they wanted to continue student teaching.

The last thing I want is for someone to go into teaching when they aren't passionate about it, and I'm kind of relieved this person quit because I'm not sure they ever would have been natural or a good teacher even with all of our coaching and encouragement.  But one of the things this person told me when I asked them why they weren't enjoying student teaching is ""It isn't what I thought it would be.""  This person watched me for four months, saw me plan lessons, went to every meeting possible, etc., and they came to this conclusion after 5 days teaching solo.  What did they think it would be?  Did they think it's just an easy gig with summer and breaks off?  Were they unaware of the fact that some days are good, some days are bad, but it always takes work?

I guess I am disheartened by the quality of people we have coming from teaching programs.  I know people aren't going into teaching right now for the obvious reasons, but almost every student teacher candidate we receive seems ill-prepared, lazy, and shocked when they see the work it takes to teach.  We had a science student teacher quit in the middle of the semester this year, and she just couldn't hack it after seeing how many hours we put in.  My student teacher always seemed very complacent and rarely excited or motivated.  That is also a personality thing, but they didn't really seem to care to get better.

So, are we stuck with shitty teacher candidates with a few bright lights here and there?  What can educators do to recruit the best and brightest even though there are obvious reasons for awesome people going in to the career.  We can't fix low teacher pay or the way we're vilified by the public and politicians, so what do we have control over?  I don't think I will ever take another student teacher again, and I hate feeling this way.  I love my job and I know it matters, and I want to help other people make a difference in the lives of kids.

I took the semester off from student teaching to help my parents and study for one more test that I could not pass last semester. I have completed all my MAT classes but I still need to finish my clinical experience. I am currently searching for teaching jobs but I am not sure if this is the right idea.
        I BOMBED my teaching demo yesterday.....I was too ambitious, nervous and did not think things through. I made a lesson that was too difficult, long, and I was not given enough time to fully prepare. I was placed in a room with 25 students and they were all clueless. I know it was my fault and could have handled it differently.  However, I was not given a standard and was just given a theme?????? I know I should have done the most simplistic demo in the history of demos...something a caveman could do. However, I fell short and did not successfully implement my demo. The principle stated that my objective was off and that the kids were confused. She said I did not time myself accordingly and was not sure why I did not know what I was doing.

......I understood my faults and didn't get defensive. However, its challenging when your blindsided and have no clue of the situation. I learned my lesson and hope to learn along the way.
I have been trained to prepare units and lesson plans. But preparing theoretical lessons isn't the same as being in the classroom. It has come to my attention that every charter school in my city has different guidelines and expectations. Most charter schools want different guidelines and expect extremely high expectations. I feel my education was theory based rather than clinical. I know I still have to finish my clinical assignment but I am scared my next assignment is not going to teach me the fundamental 21 century skills. I feel charter schools and public district schools have different outcomes and expectations. 

I am currently BUMMED! all my friends and old master teacher say I am truly meant for this profession. I am caring, speak two languages, and I love working with inner city youth. However, being a mentor and an aid is much different than being a teacher. Lets just say I'm getting sad, depressed, and feel discouraged. My first attempt to apply for a teaching position has made me realize I might not be cut out for this career. 



Any Thoughts or Advise is much appreciated.

I am student teaching at an early college high school in a 11th grade American History II classroom. For the most part, the students seem to enjoy me being in the room. My CT is an older guy and a fantastic teacher, but they seem to connect with me more. However, there is one student (let's say just for the sake of this post that her name is Susie) who honestly has the biggest attitude I have ever seen in a person and refuses to respect anyone in a position of authority (Ironically, she asked one of the english teachers at lunch the other day if she could write a letter to her military recruiter saying that she does have respect for authority and has grown out of her rebellious stage.) I could tell from the very beginning that we were going to class just from a personality standpoint, but I wasn't going to let that get in my way of improving my instruction during my student teaching. She repeatedly calls me by my first name and is extremely rude to me when I try to answer her questions. She has also told me multiple times that she doesn't have to listen to a word I say because I am not her real teacher. Today I finally reached my tipping point with her and came close to losing it in the hallway. Here is what happened:

I am walking down the hallway returning to my desk to pick up my computer to take to the other history teachers room because I have to push into her class for a period (My CT only teaches two periods a day). She is walking down the hall with 2 other people and I am walking towards her on the right side of the hall almost brushing against the wall. Even though she was the on the right side of the hall as well, we could have easily passed by each other without a problem and gone on our way. However, she makes an effort to to step in my way and I have to stop because of that. We now are just standing looking at each other face to face in the hallway and her friends have kept on walking. This is the conversation that ensues:

Me: Excuse me
Susie: Are you gonna move?
Me: Well I believe I was here first and I have the right of way.
Susie: So? You need to move.
Me: You know, I find it very ironic that you asked another teacher yesterday to write you a letter stating that you respected authority.
Susie: You aren't an authority so I don't have to respect you. 
Me: Well I do have a staff tag and you don't.
Susie: That means nothing. 
Me: Whatever. I have places to be. (I then proceed to walk around her)
Susie: That is what I thought. (She proceeds on.)

I'm sure I didn't handle that situation properly but I was just so ticked at her I didn't know what to do. Maybe I am just overreacting and should let it go.

And then I, in my grand total of four years experience, thought back a few years and realized: it was awful for me.

So, I thought I'd write some stuff that might help, even if it's just a sympathy laugh.

My first year of teaching was at a big, suburban high school where I'd passingly known the principal in my former job (regional manager for publisher).  I was sick of that life, and wanted to become Mr. Chips.  The day before school started, they had an emergency need for a math teacher; could I do it?  As I had majored in creative writing, and had even chosen a college that had no core requirements so I could avoid math, I said ""probably.""  Confidence!  (I should add I am proficient at math - it just was never a huge interest).

As horses smell inexperience, so do HS students.  My first quarter was a blur of what I'd call standard hazing:  mild deceit; manipulation; cheating on exams (oh! the ways they cheat); boundary testing; button pushing.  That said, I am not helpless and there was some initial give and take, and the occasional day when we even learned.

With the exception of 7th period.  I call(ed) this class ""the daily crucifixion.""  I had students say things like ""F**** you, you're not even a real teacher!"" when I asked them to go to the board.  7th period is a notorious catch-all where I am, and the roster was populated by those with ankle monitors, court forms to sign, etc.  Over 50 kids appeared on that roster at one point or another, a very high rate of turnover.  

By spring I was having bad dreams about the class, and my stomach would tighten when the bell rang.  Me, a person who had been comfortable addressing huge crowds of adults, terrified of a bunch of HS students who were, let's face it, not on the fast track to success.

The school graciously had me back for a 2nd year, and I resolved to never let that happen again.  I purchased a book or two (Fred Jones - good start) and realized a few things.  

1.  Their behavior is alllll about their self esteem.  So they want their friends' approval, and respect and attention wherever they can get it.

2.  Control in a classroom is elusive as quicksilver when you don't feel secure in your profession.  Please reread that - probably my best sentence in this essay.  Most new teachers rightfully feel insecure in their profession.

3.  Kids may not be good academicians, but they ain't dumb.  And they want control of the classroom.  Why?  Because messing around is more fun than the curriculum.

4.  Don't forget - their cortex is not at all fully developed!  This is why they don't care about their future - the part of their brain that's good at caring about the future is still growing.

5.  Even though we're in different roles, humanity overrides roles.  Try to have a human relationship with kids, and it's likely to be returned in kind.

6.  That doesn't mean being their friend, or liked by them.  In fact, the one mistake I see new teachers make over and over is caring too much that 'the kids don't hate me.'  Let them hate you!  Let them love you!  Let them laugh at your shoes!  Who cares?!  They're *kids*.  Their opinion of you really shouldn't be a part of your thinking.  Plus, kids' feelings change all the time.  Joey hates you today?  Don't worry, next week you'll be his favorite teacher.  They'll respect you for sticking to your standards, which makes it easier to focus on ...

7.  Your primary job, which is to focus on their learning, individually and collectively.

8.  A child who has very little going for them would just like *something* to go their way - whether it's a fleeting sense of control gained from disrupting a lesson, to a kind word from a tough teacher to getting an angry response to prove that they exist.  Adolescence is emotionally messy, and being caring does not necessarily mean you need to get involved.

I've been instructed to focus on speaking as much as possible with my students, but I'm finding it hard to predict how much time those exercises will take as it's so dependant of attendance/ability level/engagement.

I need to leave enough time for all students to have a change to speak, but that means that on days when attendance is low or they aren't chatty I end up with weird short blocks of time (~5 minutes) at the end of the lesson where they've completed all of the objective and there isn't enough time to really embark on a new task (especially since by this point most of them are itching to pack up their things and obviously clock-watching rather than interested in the lesson) but I can't just have them do nothing either.

My brief background - Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, three years experience teaching K-6 internationally, just finished TeacherReady and have my Florida K-6 cert, landed a great job teaching elementary Science and Math at an international school in China next year.

I realize that my situation is a bit different as an international teacher, but I appreciate your thoughts on this.

I just went to my first career fair and had surprising success, particularly with elementary STEM positions (which are relatively uncommon and must be harder to fill). I love teaching elementary and expect I'll be doing it for at least the next 10 years. Getting a master's seems to be only a positive thing in the international community, so the question for me isn't 'if' but rather 'when' and what to get it in.

I have 12 credits (a third of the degree) done already with CSU global's MS in Teaching and Learning (via TeacherReady) and the program looks good and fits my situation perfectly. This is a good time in my life for me to get it done, my school will help pay for part of it, I'll make more money, and be more competitive.

Now, the reasons for waiting:

1. I'm not sure if I want to be a homeroom teacher (loved it so far, but much more competition for jobs) or a STEM teacher (I think I'll love it, but won't know til next year). Maybe I'll discover I want to be a Math/Science/STEM specialist?
2. Somewhere down the line, probably in my old age, I suspect I'll end up in a leadership position. Should I wait til later and get a master's with a leadership component?
3. I can already find jobs easily enough and the money is already good.

So it really comes down to: should I start a general master's in teaching now when the timing's good for me and I can start reaping some of the benefits earlier on, or wait a year or two and get a more relevant, specialized degree?

I’m sorry if this isn’t the place for this question, but I figured I would take a shot. I am a recent graduate and new teacher and I just found out I will need to take a drug test before the year starts. I will (probably) pass the test, since I have stopped smoking and have some time. I am concerned about this test though, because it makes me think I may not be able to smoke as a teacher. I have very high anxiety and it really helps me get though when needed. Does anyone have a similar experience as mine as a teacher, and does anyone know if schools generally drug test teachers after their initial new-hire test.? Thanks so much!

Edit: Also, does anyone know how school districts handle candidates who have a medical marijuana card? Wondering if it may be a good solution to ensure I’m safe, just in case I am iffy about passing the initial test.

My understanding of this program is that I go to New Jersey with my bachelor's degree after taking some 24 hour class online, then I apply for a CE. After that, I can begin working at a public school and when I'm hired, the school will place me in a provisional teachers program, and I could go for my masters.

The principal said she was biting her tongue and stepping on her own foot under her desk the whole time to try to keep from laughing, but after the student had finished her rant she very calmly explained that I taught an English class, that English classes tend to consist largely of reading and writing, and that if we ever stopped reading and writing and started watching movies in class that the student should come tell her right away.",,7whx4y,,0,,false,1520512164,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,"",false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7whx4y/funny_student_complaint/,,HS AP ELA,,,

I'm currently in my third year of college studying Middle Childhood Education with concentrations in ELA and Social Studies. Last week I found out that I was one of a few that was accepted into my school's student teaching abroad program!! It's a placement in an international school in Differdange, Luxembourg. The way the program is set up is that I'd spend the first eight weeks of my fall semester student teaching in a local school and working on/completing the EdTPA. Then, I would head over to Lux and student teach there for the second eight weeks of my semester. I was super excited, and I still am, but I'm starting to worry about how this may look when applying for jobs. I'm unsure if it'd be a help or a hinder, since I wouldn't have as much experience working in the school system that I would be hired to teach in. I know that it's an amazing experience, but as far as practicality, would this hurt me when looking for jobs? 

I also just would like any advice that you could have for someone who is preparing to student teach! I know that I still have awhile, but I need to study for and take my OAEs before I start student teaching in the fall, and I'm feeling very overwhelmed and I have no idea where to start. 

Honestly any advice whatsoever, related to the questions or not, would be amazing at this point!! Thanks for reading! ",,82y3iq,,0,,false,1522274238,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/82y3iq/student_teaching_abroad/,,,,,

I am 18 and currently in my last year of community college before gaining my associates and moving of to a 4 year university. I have been debating with myself for a while but I honestly feel some sort of pull to become a teacher. I feel like my life wouldn't be fulfilling if I didn't teach, no other career stands out to me as something I'd want to spend my life doing. My mom has been teaching for my entire life and during that time I've been able to shadow in a way and help around her classroom and stuff when I have time off of school. I've already been in a ""teaching"" position by working for a science themed summer camp, and I will be tutoring for my college this year to get my feet wet, if you will.

The problem here lies in the fact that my mom doesn't want me to go into teaching due to how much things have changed since she started teaching roughly 30 years ago. She thinks I'd be a wonderful teacher but she just really doesn't like many of the changes she is facing today. Also, my grandparents really don't support it because my mind is going to waste if I become a teacher (WTF) and they think I wont make enough money. The argument of ""I'd rather make less and be more satisfied with my life"" doesn't do much for them, haha.

So from all this talking a question arose:

What subjects would you add to students schedule to prepare them for the real life?
What subjects should be reduced? What content should be removed? 

To give you an example:

I think, students should learn basic household skills like managing laundry, cleaning and cooking on their own, since one day, each and every student will probably move into their own apartment.

I am a first year teacher, and I think I’m realizing that I don’t want to be a teacher. 

The primary challenge that has hit me the hardest is my lack of experience. My ACP only required 30 hours of classroom observations which were tremendously insufficient in preparing me for all the pedagogical hurdles I’ve faced. I am being stretched thin, by grading and planning my week and (most importantly) coordinating with 3 people who have to observe me. 


My principal came in for a lesson and I literally wanted to cry I was so happy with how it turned out. He didn’t seem to like it though and gave me a pretty bad review and seemed to express a sever lack of confidence in my ability to handle my class. This is what set my mind into thinking I don’t want to teach. Part of me knew it was going to be the most difficult thing I’ve ever done but honestly, I hate everything about it and I feel really ashamed of myself for feeling that way. I mean, I went to college to do this and wanted it for so long. I worked really had to get here and now I just feel in my heart that this is not what I want to do with my life. 


People keep saying “oh it’s your first year and it’ll get better” but that doesn’t help. My mentors and friends give me good tips to stay on the ball but it’s just draining my spirit. It doesn’t help that I have an average of 36 kids per class, in an inner city environment. Just Friday I told a student to move to another desk and she just said “or what, I’m not gonna move.” I felt like a pussy but I was just like then stop talking, when I know I should’ve called security and had her taken out. It just seemed like an overreaction... so I just emailed her coach instead (she’s an athlete). 


Truth be told, putting it in words makes me feel better, but I’m devastated. I’m not feeling sorry for myself (I’m a drama queen), I am lucky to be where I am but I needed to get this off my chest. I would never screw the kids over by quitting, but I don’t think I’ll renew my contract. 

The purpose of this post is to see what other teachers think about this. I feel like if I express this to my team I’ll be judged... we had a long term sub quit and our department head yelled at her in front of everyone. Share with me your opinion, please. 


TL;DR It’s my first year teaching and the only conclusion anyone’s advice has given me is that I don’t want to be a teacher. ",,7552f8,,0,,false,1510412337,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7552f8/first_year_and_i_hate_it/,,,,,

To be honest, if I could start all over again as a freshman (and not have to worry about lost time, money, internship experience, etc.) I would pursue a degree in elementary education but to teach at the elementary level, would it be possible to get a masters in education after my CS BS to supplement?

That presents the opportunity that, if I structure it right, I could theoretically get a reading specialist certificate at the same time (by choosing all my electives to be from the University's reading specialist track).  

The hitch is that I am a secondary science teacher - and almost all the literature I've read suggests reading specialists are only used in early education. I'm also not convinced I want a reading specialist job per se - my interest is mostly because 1) I'm intrigued by the content, 2) my districts secondary schools have abysmal rates of students reading on grade level so it would be helpful to include reading skills in my content classes, and 3) it seems like having the cert could open doors if I want to change up my career later, or even do reading specialist work during the summer (or part time during the year?). 

Anyway, I'm looking for general advice on this area. Can a teacher split their time doing reading specialist work and teaching regular coursework (maybe half day doing pull outs and coaching, half day regular instruction)? Are there even any reading specialists in secondary schools? Is this coursework going to be so specialized that it won't help me boost reading in my general education content classes? 

I'm going to get the MS anyway for the pay bump and because I have a tuition discount in my current program. If I don't do this, I'll probably take a mix of general courses related to pedagogy and teacher research. I'm also not interested in doing an MS in my content area. 

Any advice, articles, or websites appreciated!",,780hvb,,0,,false,1510465694,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/780hvb/reading_specialist_addon/,,,,,
1508975352,teaching,elbereth3,self.teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/78rrxz/grading_between_quarters/,10,1,,,Grading between quarters.,"Hi! I'm seeking advice about grading policies in my classroom.  This is my first year in a k-12 classroom (prior I was a college instructor). I've definitely been struggling with finding the best way to evaluate students and ensure they are achieving high levels while also maintaining my sanity. 

School background: I teach at an inner-city charter school in Memphis. The majority of students are POC and from low socio-economic backgrounds. I am the only 9th grade ELA teacher. My school does not provide enough copies for me to ensure students are able to get their own texts. Because I am a TFA member, my local TFA office provides me with unlimited copies to allow students to have copies of all materials they need. During quarter 1, my school had serious trouble with scheduling and many students were shuffled in different classes for up to 4 weeks. 

My grading policy(ies): In quarter one, most of my grades came from homework and classwork. At first, I was focusing on having students submit a folder every two weeks that I would collect grades from. I quickly realized that was a total disaster when students would lose folders and not turn things in.  Additionally, during the first quarter, I would largely grade homework on completion. If they got something down sorta on topic, I gave them points. 

In quarter 2, I've changed up a few policies and I've really rethought how I do grading. I am grading more assignments as they do them in class and I'm checking homework on the daily. I've also started grading assignments for more accuracy while switching to a less strenuous grading scale. For example,  if it's complete and correct, students get a check (full marks). If it's either mostly correct or mostly complete, students get a slash (partial points). And students get an x if they don't do an assignment. Additionally, I've altered the wights for class grades to a 10% for homework; 30% classwork; 30% writing tasks; 30% tests/quizzes. 

I suppose I am seeking advice about changing grading policies from quarter to quarter. Have other teachers done this? Is it typical? Am I doing something I'm not supposed to be doing? 


TLDR: Becoming more strenuous in grading from quarter 1 to quarter 2. Do other teachers do this? ",,78rrxz,,0,,false,1510479521,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/78rrxz/grading_between_quarters/,,,,,

What kinds of side jobs work well with teaching? I'm going into my student teaching this semester, and therefore having to leave my 9-5 job due to time conflict. However, still gotta make rent so it's time to job hunt. While I'm looking, I figured that I might as well get some related work experience in case I ever need a side job while teaching in the future. Any suggestions?

I've spent most of my college career being fortunate enough to have a really nice job as a student worker in the university archives. I'm a history major so this has been great work experience for my area of study. But now that I'm trying to find work that isn't going to conflict with teaching, I'm kind of stuck. Maybe this is mostly a problem in a small college town like where I'm at currently, but there is a bit of a surplus of other people looking for nights and weekends jobs as well with similar education backgrounds to myself, but most of whom already have work experience in restaurants and what not. 

In hopes of avoiding this issue in the future, I think it would be great to get some work experience in whatever may be a helpful side job in the future as well, be it a server or delivery driver, or whatever.

As a teacher do you continue to learn or do you just teach what you’re told to teach? Will I get burnt out teaching the same thing day in and day out? Are these questions normal at this point? Did you have doubts that turned out to be ridiculous once you started? Am I being ridiculous?

These are the questions that I can’t get out of my head. I see a lot of burnt out teachers on here and on other social media and I don’t want to fall into that. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

This is my first year teaching middle school and I am in a new state. I ended up in a wholly unsupportive district and an even less supportive school. After next school year, I will likely be moving back to my original state and was going to hang on to this job until then so it didn't look like I was school hopping a whole bunch on my resume. 

Last trimester (think semester, but split in thirds) I had a mom call and complain that her kid had received a failing grade in my class. After reviewing his grades, I found that he had never submitted a huge end of trimester project (narrative essay) and that was what had tanked his grade. Mom was unpleasant to say the least but couldn't fight it much. 

She called back later saying, ""My son swears he turned it in and my son isn't a liar."" It is very rare for me to lose an assignment, especially something of that magnitude, but shit happens, so I double-checked all of my stuff just to make sure I hadn't overlooked it. I let mom know that I have absolutely zero record of this assignment. She is furious. Obviously, her 7th grade son could not possibly be lying and this was my fault. She calls the AP and files a complaint about me. AP calls me in and I explain the situation. AP actually attempts to back me up for once. So that was a pleasant surprise. 

Long story short, I find out the kid had stored the essay in a random stack of textbooks ""so he wouldn't lose it"" and just forgot to actually turn it in to me. I take pity on him and change his grade since he had technically finished the assignment on time.

Fast forward to last week. It's the end of the grading period again. This kid is throwing an absolute tantrum in class because he has a D. My co-teacher and I both explain to him that if he wanted a better grade, he should have been more concerned before the week grades are due. (This kid is gen ed.)

This kid has 22 absences for the trimester. He is usually pretty good about getting caught up, but has several assignments still missing. Mom regularly asks his teachers to send home his missing work and I had multiple times. I had invited the kid to stay after school for tutoring. I even gave him a slip of paper telling him what he needed to do to bring up his grade from an F the week prior to grades going in. But between the missing work and the half-assed essay that he failed, the best I could give him was a D. And it was definitely a pity D since he had technically accomplished the bare minimum I had listed out for him. 

So, of course, I get a call from mom furious again that her precious angel is ""failing."" I explain all the steps I took to help him and that, although it's not ideal, a D is passing and won't effect his promotion status. She complains that I didn't call home for him more regularly even though I've spoken to her more than most parents. I tell her I will try to contact her more in the future. 

She again, unsatisfied with my response, calls my AP. I, again, give him my side. She calls him a second time threatening to file a complaint against me at the district office. My AP suggests that she meet with me in person before going to district. He shoots me an email to give me a heads up.

At this point, I can either submit a grade change and bend to Mom's will or I can hold my ground and get a complaint against me. Since I'm still considered probationary, I could potentially lose my job (but I doubt it). My AP suggested that I just do what mom says because it isn't worth my reputation.

This year we had ours at a hotel attached to an airport.  I'm getting anxiety AGAIN just typing that.  Not only did we have to drive 20 minutes away from campus, we then had to maneuver airport parking and then figure out where the room was.  My team got there about a half hour late which honestly, was fine by me because I seriously hate these things \(I'm not a 'forced fun' kind of person!\).  By the time we got there the salads had already been served so we quickly found a table with another team.  The main course was a pasta with a chicken breast, it was fine.  However, I did wonder if we couldn't have sprung an extra $1.00 a person and got soda or tea.  All we got was water.  Whatever, first world problems, I know.

No one got up from the tables to mingle with the exception of a few teachers; admin stayed glued to their seats at a back table.  After lunch we had some raffles; I won a bag of candy.  There were some gift cards as well, but half of the raffle winners got the bag of candy that was weighing down the balloons at each table.

There was a slideshow and then the staff member who put the lunch together spoke.  Admin said NOT.  A.  WORD.  Nothing.  No ""thank you for a great year.""  No ""thanks to your hard work we were recognized by the state.""  Not even a ""have a good summer.""  NOTHING.  We had staff members who'd been with the school for years who are moving on, either to new placements or out of state\-\-not a word recognizing/thanking them.  It was awful.

Needless to say, the glee I felt getting in my car was indescribable.  I've already vowed not to get to next year's party.  It will be my 20th year teaching and the hell I'm going to finish it up with such an event.

So!  Your stories???  Who's lucky enough to NOT have to sit through these.....???

EDITED to add:  Whew talk about frustration in my post!!  To clarify, we've had a few parties in the past that were absolutely wonderful but not this year.  Though I don't like big group events, I do work with some amazing folks and luckily, a few of us had gone out a few nights prior to this fiasco and had a great time.  Probably why I was so annoyed with the actual event!  Well, that plus my admin's lack of interest in anything, but that's pretty much consistent with how they are overall.

One of the ways we sell the program to the community is by saying that our class is one of the best vehicles for teaching 21st Century Skills and the 4 C’s, most notably teamwork and communication. We also incorporate these skills into student grades.

I realized that we are promoting this idea and basing some part of the student grades on it without explicitly teaching the skills. Would it be acceptable for me to grade these kids on their use of the quadratic formula without actually teaching it first? Can I saying I’m “teaching” interpersonal communication and conflict resolution when I don’t actually define the concept, provide strategies, or offer practice/feedback opportunities before formal assessment?

I'd like do a better job of actually *teaching* teamwork strategies because 1) I want to cover my butt if a parent or admin finally notices, 2) I want to deal with fewer student arguments and group meltdowns, and 3) it's actually, you know, an important life skill that could have lasting effects on their future. Kinda why I chose this job in the first place.

I have done teambuilding and improv games that focus on communication and cooperation. We spent time after each activity reflecting on successful strategies and how to apply them in a design challenge. After all the games and challenges and discussions, I was disappointed to find that very little carried over into the rest of the school year. Of course, these are 11 year old kids and getting them to connect two discrete learning experiences is the Holy Grail of my career.

This year I'd like to try teaching interpersonal communication and problem solving as a formalized and assessed lesson. I don’t want to just do games or discussions, I want to approach this using the same pedagogy as I do for other complex and critical skills. I know there are many curriculums out there on teaching kids communication and conflict resolution but I cannot afford to purchase them and I would ultimately like to make this a seamless part of my existing STEM instruction. 

Do you think this is worth my time to pursue? Any thoughts on what will/won’t work?

Have you procedures, routines, expectations and management prepared. Hang up posters for students to look at that refer to these. Practice it for a month minimum. The first week or two everything will go smooth with your management. This is called the honeymoon. 
Model to students what you want them to do. Give them praise (positive reinforcement) when they do anything the right way. This will make your whole year enjoyable. The curriculum will fall into place. You dont want to have to worry about discipline half the class period and its October.

Also try to make a positive parent/guardian calls in the first two weeks to all students. I make mine 30 seconds and say I have a meeting soon. Students will know youre willing to call home. Parents will be supportive for the next call if its to help correct the student.

Here's my situation: 

* I have a Masters of Teaching from a state university here in MA
* I don't have a ton of formal teaching experience, just a year of subbing and a 6-week small classes style job working with standardized test prep. 
* I have my 8-12 grade license in English Lit/Writing and I am SEI certified
* I've never brought a lesson or unit with me to an interview before (they've never asked me to teach a sample class before, just stage 1 interviews), but I'm not sure if I should just to show them an example of my work?

Outside of that, I don't have a ton of information to provide. Honestly any help with preparing or maybe some things interviewers for teaching jobs like to see would be helpful. I really, really need to land a job soon! 

Thank you very much for any help offered. I scoured the search bar looking for advice and got some already, but I thought I'd ask for my specific situation.

I've been asked via private message on reddit about how I got out of the classroom. The thing that always makes me sad is when amazing, dedicated teachers feel lost in their life because they don't know what to do next. I went through it and I wanted to share the advice I've given numerous times over the past year. This is long. 

So now that you’ve gotten into teaching you want to know how to get out. Teaching can feel a little bit like one of those expensive, fancy haunted houses that pop up around Halloween. You want to go into it because it seems exciting and different and your friends say it will be awesome and then a small child runs at you with a knife and you scream and look for the exit.

I was a dedicated classroom teacher that made the huge leap of faith and entered the tech world. It was the scariest thing I’ve ever done. I don’t mean that flippantly. I truthfully mean that it was as difficult as a breakup. In fact it felt just like that. When people ask me how my teaching is going a year after I left, it’s like they’re just finding out a friend is newly single and they give you that look like “Should I high five you or hug you?” My entire identity was about to change (or so I thought) and I had no idea where to start. I felt the need to do something different creep over time until it was simply time. The hard part was that my internal metric of when it was time did not align with the rest of the world and I had to navigate a lot. I didn’t know where to start. I went to friends for help. And now friends are coming to me for help. So that’s where the advice for this comes from. I’ve had about a half-dozen educator friends talk to me about my process and about twenty strangers reach out via the Internet. This is that initial advice.

First things first- stop telling yourself “I’ve only ever been a classroom teacher. My resume is nothing compared to people that have been doing other things.”
STOP IT. STOP IT RIGHT NOW. You need to start looking at the bigger picture here. Most jobs that are entry level have a ramp up process for new hires. No one expects you to hit the ground running and know everything on day 1. I’ve also heard the following stupid sentences “But my degree is just in History. They wouldn’t care about that.” “I only taught basic subjects like Algebra I. You taught Statistics!” We should all stop comparing ourselves to the fictitious competitor to our perfect job. It matters less than we think it does and our stupid brains should never be the reason we don’t reach our goals. You will get hired because you have soft skills beyond compare.

How do you get your soft skills noticed? Well, the first thing I did when I started to look was show my resume to my sister. She lovingly tore it apart and told me nothing in it made sense to her. I had to translate my teaching resume into world resume. My teaching resume had something to the effect of:
Geometry and IB Math Studies
Created Problem Based Curriculum
Committee Member – Head of School Search
Committee Member – Strategic Planning

Which translated to: 
Develop problem-based learning curriculum for Geometry and IB Math Studies
Member of Head of School Search Committee – Interview Head of School Applicants
Member of the Strategic Planning Team – Dream and plan future of the school, develop 5 year plan

So look at your resume and see where you can further explain your soft skills. Teachers lead and organize anywhere from 3-6 meetings a day with groups of people that need to be inspired. They plan and deliver presentations. They think big picture while somehow still having the ability to pick up on the details. They can read rooms and understand human connection. They can cater content and think on their toes when the situation changes. They can handle pressure and intense situations. WHO WOULDN’T WANT TO HIRE THAT PERSON?

I had to explain to the rest of the world what I did using verbs that connect to the jobs I wanted.

How do you know what jobs you can do?! Well that’s a really good question. I didn’t start with that so much as “What companies fit with the reason why I want to get out of teaching?” If you haven’t read Simon Sinek’s “Start with Why?” I highly recommend it. You’re more likely to get hired when your application makes sense. When you say “I taught for X years until I realized _____ and that’s what led me here” then people think of you differently. The mistake a lot of people make I think is the _____ part. They think it has to be deep and grand and poetic. You know it could be as simple as “I realized I never worked much with adults and as I developed things with my team I realized how much joy I get from leading and developing with my peers. I think it’s time I give myself the opportunity to grow in that realm.” Find a company that interests you and monitor their jobs until something fits with you.

Explain yourself in a cover letter even if there isn’t one required. According to government statistics there are 3.2 million teachers in America. That includes the bad ones. Assuming you aren’t a bad one you’re going to want your future employer to know the difference. A cover letter makes all the difference. The cover letter should address why you are looking for such a big change.

It’s whom you know not what you know. I had coffee dates with around a dozen strangers in the process of getting my first job out of the classroom. One of them claimed to have plenty of “recovering teachers” on his team. That phrase struck me. All teachers need someone to stand up for them and say “This person deserves a shot at something new.” I would HIGHLY recommend finding people on LinkedIn that used to be teachers who now work in your prospective industry. I hit up tons of strangers and each of them helped me out in some way. Reaching out and saying “I saw you were a teacher but now you do X, I’d love to hear your story. Can we meet up for coffee?”

You won’t have to completely start over. I was worried that I’d have to get a job for the same teacher pay but now work 12 months out of the year. I will say that’s not what happened at all. I’m extremely lucky but people need to know that it’s possible to double your salary in your first job out of the classroom. It may not be possible at your geographic location but simply knowing that it’s possible to have a rewarding job that improves your quality of life can be encouraging. You can do it too.

Be patient but get over the idea that the timeline will be favorable. I know a lot of teachers who say “Yah I look for jobs every April-May but nothing really ever works out.” The part that made my job transition so difficult is that I had to quit 3 weeks into the school year. I went to the Meet the Teacher Night with my replacement and then started my new job the next day. That was incredibly stressful and I felt like I was abandoning my students. But I tried looking for a job in April through June and got no bites. The job I ultimately got and love didn’t get posted until mid July and by the time my final interview came around I had to start class the next Monday. If you’re open to the idea of moving on but don’t open yourself up to the idea of quitting mid year, you may be missing the best opportunity. Businesses aren’t going to operate on a May-August hiring calendar. If you really want a new job you may have to accept that the timeline will be less than favorable for both you and your school.

So that’s it. My story is just an anecdote and I have no idea how replicable it is. I’d love to hear from others. It took me 4 months to get a new job and I applied to well over 30 positions. I got about 6 phone screen interviews and only two in person interviews so be patient. I think the most important take-aways are that you (the teacher) deserve a job that fulfills you and you can make it happen. When we (teachers) spend all of our energy wishing the best for our students and wanting them to reach their maximum potential we can sometimes forget that we deserve the same. Sometimes that means teaching for 50 years. Sometimes it means leaving.

But no teacher can be great with one foot out the door. Good luck.

Earlier this semester, I had a family member pass away. That happened on a Thursday. That following Monday I had a deadline to have a lesson plan in to my mentor teacher. However, I had already told my mentor teacher it might be late because of what was occurring. That same Monday, my supervisor called me into a meeting saying that I missed a deadline. I told my supervisor about the family members passing and their response was: “I’m sorry, but a deadline is a deadline.”

The second problem occurred later in the semester when I told my mentor teacher I would not be coming in because I needed a personal day. Through the university, the student teachers were told that we were allowed these days and that they just had to be made up. Again, I got called into my supervisors office because this was unprofessional. 
At this point, I had to sign a contract saying that I would not miss anymore days without telling my teacher in advance. 

This past week, I came down with a stomach bug and still showed up. However, I was sent home because my mentor teacher did not want me being contagious around others. I went to the doctors office to get a note validating this. Once again, my mentor teacher said that I broke the contract by not telling him/her that I wasn’t at school. But I was at school and was sent home early by my mentor teacher.

I’m not saying I feel like I’m being picked on, and I get that I’m supposed to be professional about everything I do, but it feels like at this point no matter what I do, I can’t win. And I’m not even wanting to be a teacher anymore. Do you guys have any advice for me? Should I go over my supervisors head and talk to the department chair or just suck it up?

So I'm getting ready for my edtpa and the kids are getting used to working in groups.

A good way I've found to differentiate for each group is that their workbook pages consist of a learning target, a space for their success criteria, and empty boxes. I teach a mini lesson, we find success criteria together, then they work in small groups. They put their differentiated questions in the boxes themselves using tape.

They get all the questions on different colors of paper and they tape the color I tell them to use into a box and solve. Based on how fast they solve it and how accurate they are I tell them what color to use next. I generally have 10 questions prepared, we don't have much time and the questions are complex.

Example:
Everyone starts with the blue question.

Group A finished really fast and got it right, so they're skipping two problems and going to the orange question 

Group B needed redirection, so they're doing the yellow question before orange 

Is this crazy? Is this a thing people do?

Does anyone have research on this sort of thing?",,7xf5zx,,0,,false,1520532978,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7xf5zx/differentiating_using_tape/,,,,,

Firstly, is this acceptable behaviour for a prospective teacher? And secondly, are there any precautions in place against it?

So I'll tell you some stuff about the guy I'm talking about here. I have a friend... though he's not actually a friend at all... that wants to be a teacher. He's a far right terror to our group, mocking the lgbt in our group, arguing at every turn, preaching against femenism and women's general rights. I genuinely thought a person like him was just made up or exaggerated.  Despite his liberal subjects, he continues to antagonise everybody in our group . Sorry.  Every female in our group. The guys are perfectly safe.

In terms of studying, he has told me of his belief in A levels countless times and he seems very proud of it: Don't do any revision because he has an unconditional to a university which, lets be honest, isn't very good ( in reputation at least) at all. He wants to teach history and politics. He lacks the acceptance of others' opinions or even listening to them without shouting and at least in personal experience, calling me a stupid girl who knows nothing about politics, and refuses to have a supportive basis like pretty much every teacher does (for instance, he refuses to call transgender people by their chosen pronouns so if he had a transgender student, he wouldn't call them by their pronoun either). My question then is would he actually be fit to teach. What if he treats any of the female or lgbt students like he treats me and my friends? I'm just worried about someone like that allowed into a teaching environment is all.

I'm sorry if this comes off as a bit biased. Of course, it is because I am centre-left. But the fact of what he's said to us girls is unchangeable.

I'm a teacher of Ancient Near Eastern literature. I've found in my lecturing that analogies to modern day things have been helpful. For example: the other day, I related the symbolism of a modern political comic with the symbolism of ANE apocalyptic literature. Through this, I taught how critical it is to being a part of a culture to understand these symbols in their entirety. Things like Star Wars, Donald Trump, the Republican Party, and etc. would be so very foreign to an ANE person, just as their symbolism in their literature is to us.

Point being, analogies are very helpful, but mainly when they're done right. Are there any resources out there that would help me learn how to create better analogies for teaching? Or are there any other creative ways of lecturing \- perhaps beyond the deployment of analogies \- that you have found to help a lot?

Ignore Mr. Smith. Some kids are experts at using dad to get around mom and vice versa. Heck, maybe you were one of them. That should help you as you teach. The Mr. Smith ploy will be used on inexperienced teachers especially. Sensing that you are still insecure, students will take advantage and tell you “Mr. Smith allows phones/early recess/candy in the classroom” etc. 

Remember:
Mr. Smith probably does not allow the free-for-all your students are describing.
Even if Mr. Smith allows those phones and fidget spinners, you are not Mr. Smith and you do not have to do anything Mr. Smith does that seems to disrupt or slow down your class.
As soon as you do allow an activity based on Mr. Smith’s class, you will be hearing about that Smith guy until you want to hide in the closet at the mere mention of his name.
You don’t want to change horses in midstream very often. Can you change a rule? Yes, if that seems wise. In a school with a great deal of broken technology, you may want to sign off on short periods of phone usage. The phones are computers and sometimes any search engine in a storm will do. But be aware that changes beget demands for more changes, and all those demands suck away time.

A “NO WHINING” sign can be a winner. When you want to shut down a discussion, repeat the rule or expectation and point at the sign. If a student attempts to continue, in a calm, firm, teacher voice, say, “No whining!” Then redirect.

“It is too soon to change seating charts. Please go back to your seat.”

Having given this advice, I now have to backtrack a bit. Please always listen to students. And follow your gut. I worked in difficult schools and I sometimes broke my rules. This almost always caused me trouble, but sometimes rules must be broken. When “Analilia” asked to take “Dana” with her to the bathroom because she did not feel safe going alone, I looked at 85? pound Analilia — and I broke my “only one person goes to the bathroom at a time” rule. But Analilia seldom asked to go to the bathroom and those bathrooms had been the source of some recent, ugly disciplinary issues. Safety first. For days, I heard, “But you let Analilia and Dana go!” Honesty helps in this situation. Explain your reasoning, because you can’t ignore rules and then not explain why. Not explaining will lead to a perception of favoritism that’s potentially deadly to classroom atmosphere.

I'm teaching 9th grade (mostly, lol) Environmental Science and I have two ESL kids in my class. I found out today in my desperate search for help, that one kid (Spanish speaker) is basically fresh off the boat and speaks no English. The other kid I don't know much about, except that he speaks Arabic and from what I can tell has a small grasp on English. Our main ESL teacher, that we already share with another school, is out for emergency surgery until at least Monday. Basically what I'm asking is for any advice on what to do. Science is already like learning another language for native speakers. I'm tired of seeing these kids stare off into space in confusion while I talk and not be able to participate in ice breaker activities or complete simple worksheets. They're already in my rowdiest/biggest class, so it would be tough to try to give separate instructions to them.

I have my bachelors degree in elementary education. I taught for 2 years in a small county right after a graduated college. This was wonderful. Had great friends at the school, no behavior issues, I could leave work at work. Even if I wanted to make games or fun lesson plans outside of school, I had no problem with that because my class and the school as a whole was wonderful and I enjoyed doing things for them. I had a true passion for excelling my students because the district and school was so wonderful.

Now I'm engaged and moved to a bigger city (very inner city)school district in Alabama teaching another grade and am miserable. When I say miserable I mean I knew since Day 1 of school things were not going to fly. The kids have had had zero exposure to anything good in life, their social/emotional behavior is so dysfunctional it would make anyone bash their head against the wall, the children are completely destructive and defiant after going over rules and procedures/positive reinforcement every single second. Trying to TEACH them is like getting water from a rock.

The administration is a JOKE. Behavior issues are simply paper work to the office and the kids who do DISGUSTING and HORRIBLE things simply get a slap on the wrist.

The faculty is NO MORE helpful. I was mislead by the principal when I interviewed because he told me the school was like a family and it is NOT. We do not plan together or share ideas because everyone else is so stressed to the max there is zero time to sit down and plan well thought out lessons. Each day I fee like a fish out of water flying by the seat of my pants because I don't have anyone to share
ideas or tweak lessons with.I also have no FRIENDS at the school even though I have reached out and tried to throw myself out there. There is simply no time because of pressure brought down by the district.

My administration gives  no positivity and no praise. After any faculty/data meeting I walked away feeling defeated and asking myself ""What's the point?"" even though I have TWO very successful years of teaching under my belt. At my old school, meetings always ended on a positive note, but here it's like being in a miserable prison. 

In August I began having panic attacks so I've seen a counselor, have tried my best to relax after work, have confided in other new teachers (the other new teachers feel the same way I do) and there is no peace even now. I feel such anger and pressure because my kids are so low, the pressure of pushing them and the DIBELS scores is terrifying. I have no relationship with my class because of you give them an inch of wiggle room they will run all over you. I truly feel like each day I'm ruining my rapport with them and if I left, it would make no difference to them. I'm not doing THEM justice because my class is a train wreck and I'm not able to TEACH them.

Could I lose my teaching certificate if I quit mid year? I would only have 2.5 years under my belt. I honestly don't care if it looks unprofessional or not. To be honest, I feel like I'm being the bigger person by admitting I'm not serving this class well enough and future employers should see I was very successful for 2 years at another school, so clearly something is very off at this new school.

I need help!!,"I started working at a charter school 2 months ago and I'm already burnt out! I 'teach' 7/8th grade and am experiencing many challenges:

* As a new teacher, I have no idea how to assess student's levels in reading, writing, and math. I can rank them against each other, but I don't understand how to apply this to the curriculum standards. 

* Right now, my organization is off. When I started the job they didn't tell me I was going to be the permanent teacher. As a result, I have no time at all to plan for anything- Right now, I make worksheets for them in class and as they are working on those worksheets, I make another for when they are done. This means that I have papers everywhere and am not creating activities. 

* If I do the grades accurately, everyone fails due to missing work, or due to not recording grades on my end. At this point, I can't keep up.

* All the students are at different levels. (one is esl and may have dyslexia (???)- there are no services in the school for specialty help)

* There are no science or social studies books for my grade. (When I arrived, the kids were studying from a 5th grade social studies book)
(there aren't many books at all as the school doesn't have a library, so I've been collecting and bringing in books for the past few weeks)

* We were introduced an online curriculum guide last week, which outlines what they should be doing and when, along with sample exercises. The only problem is the online guide does not line up with the curriculum in the classroom. So the topics I have been focusing on, were supposed to be done months ago. It's just so confusing to figure this out, especially with no textbooks for reference and having no record of what the students already know. 
* At this point, the principal stopped talking to me (mm pretty sure because I'm not always punctual) and the other teachers are unqualified and also in over their heads. I have no mentors. 

Positives/What I have accomplished:
*  Classroom management is under control

* The kids are more interested in reading since I arrived

* The lowest performing student has made huge strides forward as I've been giving him heavy guidance.

* They are doing their homework more often than when I first started

* I've learned patience in the context of teaching academia (wow)

* I've figured out how to better connect with students, understanding what they like to talk about and how to transfer that into the classroom.

I am a high school biology teacher at a private boarding school. I just finished my 2nd year teaching and am relatively inexperienced at it, though I do think I am getting better and I do like the job a lot. I've been considering getting an M.Ed since I can learn more about teaching and maybe specialize to help my career advancement. However, I have heard from a few people that for secondary teachers, it's not really worth getting an M. Ed. They say the biggest benefit is the increase in salary, and you can get that with any masters degree. Some suggest masters in your content area instead.

In my situation, I could, in theory, keep my job and get my M. Ed part time from the local university at a very reasonable cost (my school pays for part of it provided I still work full time at the school, plus I'm a state resident and it's a public university). So, part of me says, why not get it? If it's affordable and doable and useful, I could get the M.Ed, and then always go back to school later if I'd like to for another degree. Professionally, my goal is to work in administration at an independent school, so think Dean or Headmaster, or somewhere in between. So it may be helpful to get that MEd in administration or some other similar subject. My biggest reservations are a.) Is it really going to be helpful for my career? Are M. Eds more helpful for public school teachers, or teachers who teach elementary/middle? and b.) Do I really want to get my degree part time, or should I jump head first into it?  

Alternatively, I could get an MS in Biology, though I have done a decent amount of biology research in the past and don't think that's a path I would want to go on. Lots of independent school administrators have their MBA, so that is also an option, but $$$ may be tricky. 

Lastly, I was a dual Biology &amp; English major in college, with emphasis on creative writing, so I love writing and did it a lot in college and do it now as a hobby, so an MFA is also on the table if it really just doesn't matter what I get my masters in.

I hope it's alright to post this here, but after 3 years of studying for a degree in Animation, I feel that my true calling is to teaching, and I need some advice.

After some research I see that you mainly need a minimum of 2:2 degree, at least 2 weeks work experience, a professional skills test, good GCSE's and a background check.
I have a 2:1 degree in Animation and I want to teach Art or Graphics at Secondary or College level, possibly even primary. I have very good GCSE's, no criminal record and am good with children, will this be enough?

Should I contact local state schools for work experience or private schools (does it matter)? Will a B.A. degree allow me to teach in an art subject?
Do you have to have a masters to teach in college? 

In an ideal world I would love to teach graphic design, I am very skilled in Photoshop and other digital arts software, however I'm not sure if I would be able to do this since secondary schools usually only teach graphics as a part of D&amp;T, and I'm not sure if I'm qualified to teach at college level. 

Also I'd love to hear some stories of how some of you became teachers. I'm worried that I might not be accepted because I'm 21, but I have no idea of the average age that teachers begin their careers.

I feel that being a teacher would be very fulfilling, and I am aware of some of the difficulties it can include, but I am ready and eager to make this my career.

My student is 6, and generally pretty sensitive to her peers normally. On top of this, her father just walked out on the family, so she has been EXTRA emotional, as one would expect, and has not (to my knowledge) seen a professional therapist yet. 

In my classroom, she has been causing a lot of disruptions. If she even has the slightest thought that someone is making fun of her, she screams at the top of her voice and begins to call herself names/yell at herself. She is clearly having a hard time with the abandonment and is taking it out on herself. I look for every opportunity to use positive reinforcement with her and tell her how awesome she is any chance that I get, but she doesn't take it in.

Her behavior is becoming REALLY disruptive and stressful to the other children in the class. When she starts screaming/gets really upset, I allow her to go to the office to reset and come back when she is ready. She has been sent home a few times because she is just too out of sorts. 

Does anyone have any advice for dealing with this child? I want to support her and show her love because I know she needs it so badly right now, but I also can't have the rest of my class feeling uncomfortable/unsafe because of her outbursts.

Overall, I'm happy with my rubrics, but I'm always looking for new elements to consider assessing. The tricky thing with posters is I feel that most of the time, as a student, we were pretty much assessed on:

1. Does it follow the prompt?

2. Does it look like shit?

Unfortunately, that wouldn't really fly at my school. It's private, and pretty much everybody is good at basic directions-following. I'd like to assess criteria that exhibit some critical thinking.

My two major poster assignments are:

1. A presidential campaign poster that has to reflect Enlightenment values (for my American lit class)

2. A Utopia or Dystopia propaganda poster that has to reflect 4 categories from our Utopia unit for my sophomores.

My rubrics work, but they're the ones that I'm least happy with. Any specific criteria that you guys use for posters?

So I have decided to go for my Master's in Education. I really want to teach in private schools. I am passionate about independent and progressive education, and I would take a position as a private school teacher over public in a heartbeat if offered both.

So here's my dilemma. I'd ideally like to get both my Master's and credential at the same time, because--despite my strong preference for private school teaching--those jobs are much more scarce. If I have my credential, at least I could get a public school job while waiting to get hired at a private school.

However, there are some programs that look really appealing to me, but that only grant the M.Ed, with no credential (Johns Hopkins, UPenn, etc). 

I'm not sure if I should cross these off my lists because they don't offer the credential. I know getting certified AND getting my Master's is the most practical option and the best bang for my buck.

But I guess my question is: are private school jobs REALLY that much more scarce and hard to get? If I'm open to teaching K - 12 and have a Master's from an elite school like Johns Hopkins or UPenn, will I hypothetically have a decently easy time at getting hired?

I’m 27 and teaching a myriad of subjects at an alternative school. One of the courses is dance (which is now dawning on me to have been a colossally terrible idea). I have been, on numerous occasions, sexually harassed by my students—lewd comments, gawking, inappropriate touching. I went to my administration with it, suggesting that we change the course because I’ve tried to change the conduct, and I went away feeling guilty, without a solution. Things were said like “maybe there’s something wrong with the class,” implying that I was doing something that invited the behavior. Well, apparently just my doing my job (dancing and trying to teach them to dance) incites sexual harassment. 

Any teachers been harassed by students? I’m feeling super down right now; I dread the class and going into work tomorrow. It seems like my administration thinks the kids can do no harm (these are low SES kids from disadvantaged backgrounds at a a credit recovery alternative school). 

I need some encouragement because I can’t even believe I was just shamed and blamed for being harassed. As if teachers can’t be harassed.

I was just hired as a permanent first grade teacher. I am replacing a teacher who got a promotion. I am feeling super nervous because 1/4 of the year is over. 
I was told that I would have some time to be with the students and the current teacher to make the transition go smoothly, but I honestly don't think that is going to happen. Seems like I'll be starting on my own right away, which is ok I suppose but I am just nervous. 

Any suggestions on what to do the first day?

It's not like a typical first day and I know the students are in a really great routine already and I am so nervous about messing up. 
In case you are wondering, this is my second year teaching.

Thank you for listening.

I have an issue with my daughters high school and thought this would be a good place to ask for advice. This may be lengthy.

Situation: 17 year old daughter is enrolled in a PA public high school. It is her junior year and she was enrolled in a Algebra II math class. After the first week of school their teacher had ""personal issues"" and left the school. They initially had a short term substitute teacher (not certified to teach high school math). At first the school made it seem the teacher was not going to be absent for an extended amount of time. The substitute teacher was unable to teach the material to the students. Our daughter told us that she would put problems on the board and ask the students to work through them at their desk. When asked questions she was unable to show the students how to solve the problems or answer most of the students other questions.

Stupidly my wife and I kept quiet thinking the teacher would return after a week at most. The teacher did not return. The principal assured the parents they were hiring a certified math teacher. Several more weeks go by and the principal states that they have hired someone that will start the following Monday (its already mid-late October). Monday comes and the substitute is still ""teaching the class"". The principal claims that the person they hired did not show up to work and states they are looking at other applicants. This goes on through the rest of the semester. No teacher was hired and the students received a grade of ""P"" for the class.

They have now been told by the principal that they may take the final for the Algebra II class whenever they feel ready. Once they take the test they will receive that grade for the year.

The principal has offered after school tutoring (45 minutes, 4 days a week) by the basketball coach. Come to find out the coach is certified high school math teacher. He also offered them to take an after school credit recovery program for the class. Credit recovery is for when a student fails a class and needs to make up the credit instead of attending summer school. They said that they will not put them into a regular Algebra II class for the next semester (they have several other Algebra II classes with an average class size of 20 students).

It may also be important to note that the principal never contacted parents that there was an issue. The only reason we knew was from our daughter. We would then have to contact the principal for updates about the situation.

We are concerned about the upcoming SAT's, what this will look like on her transcripts (if a college sees credit recovery it seems to say the student failed the class), and concerned because she deserves to have a decent education.

Basically I am looking for information. Is there a way to force the school to enroll my daughter into a regular full time math class?

Our other thought was having the school pay for a tutor of our choice that can work with our daughters schedule (weekends or nights).

Do we have to accept the after school programs and force our daughter to go? 45 minutes of tutoring does not equate a full time class to us. A couple notes on this. Our daughter also works after school to pay for her own car and insurance and this would have an impact on her ability to do this and save for college.

Are there any other options/resources for us short of suing the school district? Is that an option?

Thank you for your help! I know this was a lot of questions and wall of text so thanks for sticking in there.

I may also post this to education and legal subreddits.",,7sfls2,,0,,false,1518574498,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7sfls2/high_school_teaching_issue_pa/,,,,,

I've finally narrowed down my choice substantially and have been accepted into Liberty University's online MAT in secondary education. It will probably cost me ~20k and probably 15-18 months to complete.

I'm also really intrigued by Teacher Ready given that it is 6k, however I'm missing out on a potential 5k a year without the master's.

I'm trying to think if it is worth just going straight for the MAT or messing around with transfer credits and getting certified and then transferring in to have it be a few thousand dollars cheaper.

It probably doesn't matter in the long run as that's like a month's salary where I would try to teach at. I might be focusing too much on the money, but it's hard not to. I really want to be a teacher and have been subbing and coaching for a few years now and I love the environment.

Because experts have a deeper well of experience, it takes them longer to compare the redundant information with their past experience. That means the more expertise they have, the greater the drag on their cognitive resources the instruction will be.

Basically, over-explaining is bad. An intuitive notion, but I have upgraded the practice from ‘annoying/boring’ to ‘actively detrimental to development’. Perhaps the citation will help all of you as well.

I work with a preschool class, 4 year olds. Their regular teacher is in her 70's. She is amazing, and runs a very tight ship. The kids are very little trouble for her. However, she has been out since December, due to an injury, and just within the last week has started teaching again. She's in the classroom M-Th mornings. The rest of the time, I'm with the children alone. I'm in my middle 20's. Half of the class is very well-behaved. However I have some boys who couldn't care less about what I say. They talk back to me, yell at me, a lot of the time completely ignore what I say. Trying to sit down with the class to teach them is next to impossible because 2 or 3 of them won't sit still, talk to whoever is next to to them, or even start hitting/kicking. I can tell them not to do something, like call a classmate a name, and they turn around do that exact thing. 

I have them sit out. I've tried talking to the director. I've talked to parents and sent notes home. These students don't seem to respond to anything I do or say.

We were doing an exercise on ""Can I explain why different people have different beliefs?"". This poor kid was fully in tears because he did not know what to write.

I gave him a pep talk about how it was fine if he could not think of anything (it was not a test, just gauging their understanding for starting RE), but that he probably did know lots and just did not know how to put it into proper sentences. So just write bullets, even if it was just the names of some different religions or about what happens at Christmas.

Then I told him that if he gets stressed out like that to take a deep breath and smile because that will trick his brain and calm him down. We took some deep breaths together and he said he felt like he could do something now so I left him to it.

I went back to him later to see how he was getting on. He had got a couple of sentences down and he said;

""Thank you before for the super boost.""

Honestly, I'm open to constructive criticism and I'll try to implement what she says, but going back three years to grad school, my professors taught me one way of writing objectives, then the principal at my first school wanted them written a different way, and now, in my second year at my current job, my supervisor wants me to change them again. I do well with the practical aspect of my lessons in terms of student engagement and proficiency, but, apparently, the objectives need work in my supervisor's opinion. Getting past the fact that I think lesson plans (the physical act of writing them in depth) are a waste of time and with this being the third person asking for a different form of objectives, I'm just kind of over it. I was wondering if anyone has a template they use for writing objectives? I want to make writing the objectives the easiest part of any prep. I'll do whatever my supervisor suggests, but I'm done stressing over something so small. Not saying objectives are insignificant. I'm saying that the physical act of writing them is and it's taken up far too much of my energy when I could dedicate that time to much more productive activities like developing/searching out innovative ideas for lessons.

So I have 6 preps (I teach 6-8 Science and History). Lesson planning is killing me. It is extremely challenging for me to have meaningful lessons (because of the time spent on each prep), and the amount of time I spend working outside school hours is getting out of hand, especially when combined with preparing materials, writing objectives on the board, and grading papers.

My school has employed the gradual release of responsibility model, which means every lesson is required to have instruction/modeling, then guided instruction, then collaborative (paired) work, individual work, then assessment. (work doesn't necessarily mean graded work or worksheets, usually I try to have 1 or 2 open ended style questions, and slowly work my way to the point where we are on the individual part, and I'll have them answer the most important question on their own)

Trying to teach 6 different subjects while making each part of the GRR model meaningful is extremely hard to manage.

I try to guide my lessons around a broad question to help my students make sure they are on top of things, and I'm using DBQs when I can, but the day-to-day lessons I feel are getting monotonous - I don't have the time to really differentiate my lesson styles, or use activities that require a lot of prep.

Any strategies you can share that might help me out? What are some good activities for history that fit into guided instruction and collaborative learning that do not take up too much time (10-15 minutes for each)? Or any ideas on how to teach new vocabulary? What kind of procedures have worked for you when teaching history? Knowing the content isn't the problem, I love what I teach and I know it well, but it feels like my lessons often do not run smoothly. I feel like I'm doing something wrong.

Edit: thank you all for your advice! Some of it was very valuable. Coincidentally, someone from the organization that trains our teachers will be here later this week, and I will be meeting with them. The email I got sent said ""history is different, as it does not fit into the GRR model as well as other subjects."" So I'm hoping I will have a better idea later this week on how to plan more productive lessons more efficiently. I love the content, but it is fitting the content into a model that is challenging. It always feels like I have to cut interesting topics because they don't contribute to the main objectives enough, and unfortunately time is limited. 

For those of you saying I need to switch schools: I know teaching at a Catholic school isn't the most economically sane choice, and of course the teaching load is greater than at a public school, but I'm here for many reasons - reasons that are more important to me than salary and less preps. There are good things that come with it, and those things are what brought me here instead of going into public education.

The school doesn't give homework or require students to bring materials because many families don't have the time/money to help with homework or buy materials.

I'm inspired by the teachers I've shadowed because they care so much for their students. They have one-on-one, compassionate discussions with the students that act out, and their management styles are both firm and kind-- many of the tell the kids they love them and the kids say ""we love you too!"". Needless to say, I'm so thankful of the teachers that are mentoring me, and I'm excited about my spring practicum experience.

Oh, and here's one of my favorite things a student has done so far: I was tutoring a core support math class, and one of the students politely asked me if I could borrow a pencil. It was clear there was a procedure for this, because the students had to borrow all of their materials. I gave him one of my extra pencils,  expecting to never see it again. The period ends and I head toward my next class, and the student comes fastwalking at me, yelling. ""I have to give you your pencil, Ms.midori_kaminari!""

I'm currently in my first year of K-12 education (college instructor previously) and I'm seeking advice concerning IEP accommodations. 

I am specifically dealing with a situation in which a student has an IEP that requires modification of test items (length/difficulty). For our weekly tests (mandated by the ELA department at my school), I give this student a modified test with only two possible answers on each multiple choice question. She then goes to take the test with the 501 coordinators to meet the extended time accommodation. Student still fails test and then asks to redo the test to meet her accommodation for test/assignment redos. 

I email the 501 coordinator concerning this issue since it seems a little unfair that the student is allowed to retake a test where she only had two options to begin with. I get a reply that tells me I can give the student another test or something else (extra credit, verbal testing, or a project). 

I'm just a little confused about how to give the IEP accommodations. Many of my IEPS are fairly confusing and I often find it very difficult to do things like verbal testing with ELA materials when half of the point is being able to analyze something you've read. It's also very difficult to make an easier test when I'm already using test questions from our test question bank that are labeled as low. 

I guess I'm just looking for any advice on how you've made these accommodations work in your classroom. I'm especially interested in any teachers who have done this in a secondary ELA setting. 

Thanks!!

[Edit] I suppose I should clarify a few of the points I mention above. When I say that the IEPs are confusing, I mean that I often find myself unsure of your to enact all of them without creating a ridiculous amount of variations on one assignment. I'm already working about 13-14 hours a day and I'm trying to streamline the process instead of making it more complex. Secondly, I'm not positive when it's be able to work in alternate testing formats. Students have a jacked packed day and the only time if have to do something like a verbal test would be after school. Most students can't stay after school in my area.

I am in my 6th year teaching at a Title I Elementary school, we are pretty close to the bottom of school rankings for our state. There are many students from low-income families, many students with incarcerated family members, and some students who are refugees. We have an amazingly diverse school environment. However, our administration has slowly been declining. Already low test scores are dropping, severe student behaviors are increasing (I'm talking tantrums where students are throwing chairs, tables, you name it)

It is incredibly exhausting. I feel like I am completely losing my excitement for teaching. I am constantly managing class behavior. I have kids hitting each other all the time, swearing at each other, complaining about completing work, etc. I have been unable to get any parent assistance in any way. 75% of my class is below grade level and I am busting my butt to see improvement, and while I see growth, there is no way I am going to be able to get these students to grade level benchmarks.

The school environment is declining as well as our Principal has pretty much completely checked out. I feel like this is trickling down to the faculty pretty quickly. I have heard from 6 or 7 teachers that they are thinking of moving schools this year. My team is very hard to work smoothly with and I really struggle to work effectively with them, our team leader is very forgetful and doesn't tell us half the stuff we need to know from the principal. 

On a positive side, I work with some amazing people. I enjoy the kids and I have great relationships with students and parents at the school. 

I am thinking about moving schools next year but I feel so guilty. I have so many kids from past years that come visit me and tell me how much they loved my class. I don't want to disappoint anyone by leaving but I am completely drained.

How do you survive being at a school with a difficult work environment? And how do you decide when it's time to move schools? I would love to hear any of your personal experience with deciding it is time to try out another school.

I do, on occasion, probably toe the line between what is an acceptable amount of banter and what is not. I also recognize the importance of knowing which kids can take a little ribbing and which can’t. I’m sure I’m not alone here especially with my fellow high school teachers.

Anyway, I have a student who has been wearing a back brace for a few months and has been very open about how his doctor says he’ll have to wear it for a while and how it sucks, etc. Today he was talking during a test and I had fussed at him a few times about quieting down. Then, I see his body completely turned around in his desk in order to talk to a student behind him, so I say “Student! This is why your back messed up! Turn around and hush!”

I knew as soon as I said it that it was out of line. He turned around and I could immediately tell he was hurt. I quickly apologized saying that was out of line. Right after this, the test ended and we moved on to another activity but I could see him trying not to cry. I felt horrible but I didn’t want to call any more attention to it at that moment. I asked him to stay after class and  repeated how terrible it was for me to say that and that I couldn’t imagine what it was like to wear his brace every day and that he didn’t deserve to be talked to that way especially not by a teacher or an an adult. I told him I was very truly sorry. He wouldn’t make eye contact with me and just said “yes ma’am” and left.

I know I screwed up and I’m going to have to work very carefully to earn this kid’s trust back. 

What’s your immediate regret monster moment?

A child in my class got presented with this question today on the online prodigy game.

“A group of researchers were estimating the total number of elephants in a herd, on the first day they went out and tagged elephants, the second day they went out and counted elephants. What is the estimated number of elephants in the herd based on the gathered information?

Total tagged elephants - 10

I am a substitute teacher right now and a soccer coach, I would like to teach in my home state of Illinois and I am looking at licensure requirements and MAT programs.

The state hasn't gotten back to me about these questions and it looks like it takes them a long time to do pretty much anything.

Does anybody know if there are any online programs that are accredited and approved by the ISBE? Perhaps that they don't listen on their website, as they have pre-approved coursework from out-of-state universities.

Or is it less of a hassle to  transfer state teaching licenses than it is to pay an extra 10 grand  on schools like Dominican, Loyola, or National Louis?

Hope somebody can answer my question, it probably depends on subject, endorsements, and other qualifications. My background is in social studies, however, I think I would be a good Biology teacher and places like National Louis offer MAT degrees for those who have a bachelor's in another subject.

Were you ever the slacker? Were you the go getting over achiever? Just kind of average? Did you enjoy school? Or did you think it was pointless at times?

Do you think the type of student a person was has any indication on how well they’ll teach or enjoy teaching? Or could it just indicate that they didn’t mesh well with the teacher?

I am a first year history teacher abroad who with the help of some wonderful students started up a Pen Pal club at the beginning of this school year. For the most part it started off fine, however, just before Christmas the correspondence between my students and the school we were initially writing with completely halted. I have spent the past two months hoping maybe the lapse was brief and then, after it had gone on too long, trying to find other teachers/students to write with from my colleagues here to no avail.

The students participating in this club are wonderful, driven students who really want to make connections with people outside of their home country. While they have many international teachers, the interactions with international peers are at times not as consistent. I would like to help them with this in anyway that I can, and is part of the reason why I thought a pen pal club would be a great idea! However, in order to do that the students need someone to write with.

If you are interested here is a little more specific information about the club. The 15-20 students I work with in this club are grades 8-12 and have very strong English for non-native speakers. Because of this, all correspondence would need to be primarily in English and it would be preferable to correspond with other high school students. Additionally, we are a 1 to 1 school, therefore, the students prefer to use email or other forms of online communication as the basis for their correspondence. The most important thing we are looking for, however, is a group of students who are absolutely dedicated to this wonderful opportunity. If students aren’t 100% committed to the idea, it makes everything that much more difficult.

I am hoping that you and your students may be interested in this opportunity! I believe that this is a wonderful opportunity to build a more global community among students. It is through opportunities like these that we can start breaking down the barriers that often times divide our society and world. I am well aware that many of you and your students might not have the time to do such an activity, however, if you do and if you think that this is something you would be interested in, please PM me and I can provide you with a little more information about where I teach, the nature of the school itself, and how I hope the correspondence might go. It is almost 9:30 PM for me right now, so if you are in the US know that I may not respond until later tonight for you.

So I'm being recruited to help a university professor flip his 350 student lecture hall. The content is biology. If you're unfamiliar with flipping a classroom (because you still have might some good ideas!), you stop lecturing during class and use that time for learning activities. Before class, students are responsible for watching videos or reading the content so that they are ready to use what they learn in class.

So the challenge is what strategies could be used for in-class activities in such a large lecture hall? I can think of some strategies for 20-30 students, but 350 changes things.

Definitely hoping to get some ideas and hear your guys' thoughts! Brainstorming is welcomed. ",,715uj5,,0,,false,1507576506,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/715uj5/how_to_flip_a_large_lecture_hall/,,,,,

I am a 3rd year teacher, and this year I moved to a new state, school, and grade level. No matter how hard a day I had in the past, I was always excited to teach again the next day. This year, however, I am having some major discipline problems, and I have absolutely no support from my admin. It's to the point where I hate my job and am considering leaving the profession until I can move back to my old state. 

I used to teach freshmen and sophomore English in a pretty low-income school. I LOVED my job. As a new teacher, I was obviously still learning a lot, and by the end of last year I was so excited to start a new year. I felt like I was finally finding a management system that worked and had an arsenal of new engagement strategies and lessons that I'd refined. My strength had always been building relationships with my students.

This year I am teaching 7th and 8th grade in a low-income school. I knew it would be different, and so I spent the entire summer reading up on some new things to adapt for the younger age range. I even went to a few summer trainings in the new district to familiarise myself with their policies, mission, and curriculum. I was SO excited to start the school year.

Fast forward 8 weeks. . . I feel like these are some of the best lessons I've ever created but they are being completely wasted due to the behavior issues. My old school was a PBIS school, so I have a very positive-intervention based approach. I also tried to come in pretty strict with procedures in the beginning of the year. The kids know my expectations. I just feel like there's no way for me to hold them accountable.

I've made probably 50 calls home. If I called every time I needed to, I'd be making 15 calls at the end of every day (and I was at the beginning of the year). I've written several office referrals, but the office doesn't back me up. 

For example, I have one student who has been a behavior problem from day 1. He's gotten multiple calls, multiple warnings, tried conferencing with him one-on-one and building a relationship, tried positive reinforcement. I even put him on a behavior contract and he broke it within a day. I finally bit the bullet and wrote him up. I got a call later that day from my AP asking what interventions I'd put in place. Told her all the steps I'd taken (which were also listed on his referral). She asked what the parent had said. Told her the parent was at a loss with what to do with the kid as well. She told me that I needed to set up a parent meeting at the school with mom and that she would TRY to make it. (Told her when it is and she still hasn't replied to the email letting me know if she's coming or not.) She also told him to write me a letter of apology and this is what it said word-for-word: ""I'm sorry for my behavior. I promise to be a better student and stuff.""

It's becoming more and more obvious that the students have no consequences and they know it. They don't take any type of discipline seriously because they know our threats are empty. They've been giving kids bags of hot Cheetos for not getting into fights. The same AP told my 8th graders that even if they fail every class they will still move onto high school, so they don't care about grades. Calls home obviously don't work. My AP told me to start handing out detentions, but I know most of them won't bother to come. And even if they do, it'll be more of a punishment for me than for them. 

I even have some kids I'm not allowed to punish because their parents have threatened to sue. Those are the best ones. One kid is on his phone all calls. Turns nothing in. Leaves the room whenever he wants. Takes 20 minute bathroom breaks and I'm not allowed to punish him. It's a joke. 

I'm honestly at a loss. Any advice or encouragment would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the long post. I'm just tired of hating a job I used to love.

TL;DR I am at a loss for how to hold my kids accountable and have no support from administration. ",,73y4ua,,0,,false,1510390338,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/73y4ua/needing_some_moral_supportadvice/,,,,,

I have been studying to go into special ed severe for several years now, but as I have just moved across the country I am taking a hiatus and took a position at a Montessori school. 
As I have only been working here 3 months my opinions aren’t fully developed, but I’m curious to see what others thoughts are regarding this alternative form of education. 
I have found for some children (particularly individuals with ADHD, autism and other sensory based idiosyncrasies) the environment of complete freedom and autonomy can be very overwhelming for them, resulting in a higher frequency of behavioral outbursts. I also get concerned seeing some children choose to nap or paint all day when they are 5 years old. Not that these activities aren’t beneficial  but I think a more structured emphasis on reading and writing is very important at that age.
Each day I’m learning and I appreciate this opportunity sincerely. I don’t think this kind of schooling is horrendous by any means, in fact I think they employ some useful techniques, but it’s definitely not a good fit for everyone. 

Anyone experienced teaching tradition &amp; montessori, or any other forms of alternative teaching?

I’ve heard that it’s possible to kind of start over and reinvent the classroom after the two weeks off. I know that at the beginning, I was not consistent enough and didn’t spend enough time on rules and procedures. I was also probably too nice. So I know to make sure to spend time on them when we go back again. But I’m concerned the kids won’t take me seriously since some of them are accustomed to misbehaving with me. Their behavior isn’t just super, super bad. It’s mostly talking a lot when I tell them to stop, and I have a few here and there who take it to the extreme and play around when they’re not supposed to, have major attitudes, etc. 

I guess I’m wondering how long to spend on procedures, etc? What are some things I can do to make sure they take me seriously? I do always give consequences and have gotten a lot better about enforcing them. I also have 5 different groups of kids - they rotate classes.

Has anyone taught this before? Did you find it successful? Any resources out there? 

I guess my overall dilemma is how to teach this novella without proselytizing young people. There are merits to individualism, but I wouldn't want to promote the idea that selfishness is some great virtue. (I think it's doable without getting into that, but just curious as to some thoughts.)

I'll be graduating from college next May and am strongly considering a career in secondary English teaching. I've found quite a lot of teaching fellowship programs at top boarding schools around the country, and I'm interested in applying to a lot of them.

But I've never lived the boarding school life either as a student or in any teaching capacity myself, so I'd love some insight from any current or former boarding school teachers here. 

I'm especially curious to know if the work day is as long and intense as it seems like it would be. 

From what I've read so far, it sounds like boarding school teachers barely get a moment to themselves, between teaching classes, coaching sports and supervising clubs, and helping with dorm life. 

Is it super intense? Do you get adequate time to recharge your batteries? Are you able to have any life of your own outside of the school? 

I'm an extravert and typically have a lot of energy, but I'm honestly a little intimidated by the idea of having to be ""on"" from morning till night every single day. 

Any info and advice would be appreciated!

Yesterday we were reading a free verse poem and in order to reiterate the freeness of it, I had students clap a steady beat and purposely read it struggling to keep up with one rhythm. Students of course clapped all out of whack on purpose to be funny, but one student in particular began clapping quickly, moving his hands to his lap and making a face suggesting he was...pleased...essentially he was fake masturbating. I sent him out and wrote him up. 

Called his mom today to follow up and got chewed out for 20 minutes. She said I behaved unprofessionally by writing him up based on something I perceived as sexual, that I was the inappropriate one. That I have presumptions about her son that aren't true and that she will be contacting people to make sure this is taken off his record. So much more that I don't feel like explaining. 


Have never had my professionalism criticized for something that seems so blatantly backwards...your child was being inappropriate and I'm the one in the wrong? 

There's a lot more context, but it's days like today that make me question if this is a job I can do until retirement. It's 80 percent thankless and getting shit on from every direction. Doesn't help it's only my 3rd year I'm sure. 

Anyway, this is obviously going to the hire ups, and I'm not totally sure how I should handle this? Go against what I know I saw and ""admit fault,"" or stand my ground. I think young men need to learn early on that that kind of behavior is not okay and makes others uncomfortable. What message does it send that the people witness to his grossness are the ones getting in trouble rather than him? 

Not to mention, this student has a history of being super inappropriate. This is most certainly not the first time he's gotten in trouble for something like this.

I’ve given serious consideration and decided I want to go through with my lifelong ambition to become a teacher. My question is;

Is a bachelors degree good enough with the proper certifications?

What do I need to study in college to be qualified to teach?

What area of teaching is in highest demand? (History and English were my best subjects but I’ve been told the greatest need is for Science).

I’m still working on my associates degree in liberal arts since I figure it’d be a good stepping stone in to my bachelors.

What is the job market for teachers like right now? I know they don’t make that much in the way of money but for me that’s not the point. 

Also if I’m able to become a teacher, I want to move to the Southwest, preferably NM, AZ, UT, etc..

I had just finished the middle school and built a really good relationship with my CT there, but this is my first week at the high school and I'm already afraid I ruined my relationship with my CT because I had to call out sick last minute this morning.  I don't know if the fact I'm working 20 hours a week, student teaching, and going to class finally caught up to me, but I had been going strong all year.  What had happened was I had gone to bed at a decent hour, woke up, taken a shower, and as I was about to leave I felt some awful pain in my intestines and proceeded to be stuck on the toilet for about 5-10 minutes.  I texted him that I couldn't make it and sent my lesson plans, but he sent me, ""You need to detect these things earlier.  You are not calling out of work at a part time job, this is your profession.  Remember, your first year will be probationary.""  Any CTs here?  How bad is this if it doesn't happen again?  Do you think this is something he'll hold over my head for the next five weeks?  Is it better for a student teacher to go in and leave early if they're sick?

I've just begun my second year teaching at an international school in Europe. I'm a bit stressed about clearly establishing classroom rules in the beginning. Last year I had some problems with classroom management, in part because I started subbing mid-semester. Now I'm certainly better-established as a teacher whom most students know, and so far so good. Most of my classes are complete beginners or false beginners, with a couple of more advanced kids, as well as the occasional native or near-native thrown in. Ages from 6 to 8. I know their L1, so I can resort to translation, but I want to do it as little as possible. I also teach older classes (up to 12 years old), but their level is much higher, so it's not as much of a problem.

Any ideas or resources for clearly establishing classroom rules with students at a low level? Any ideas for specific rules I should implement?

Don't speak when others are speaking, don't speak without being nominated, don't get up without asking, don't use L1 without asking is what I have so far. Probably some more general stuff like be polite to others. I also want to give them a smiley or sad face after each lesson for their behaviour. Three sad dudes and I talk to your parents is the idea.

I'm sorry if what I've typed out seems low-effort, but that's because just thinking about it makes me fear the eventual problems. I feel completely stumped. It's been going well so far, but I know it'll only get more and more difficult, if I don't establish a more rigorous framework early on.

(LTS' are not eligible for PD or evaluations, which is relevant).  Was immediately displaced when that school re-structured for the following year... last in, first out!  Take a position at another school in the district, but it is outside of my certification so they beg me to get emergency certified for ESL.  I say sure! and start taking classes and teaching.  
Year 1: they never even realize I am a new hire as such the principal does not have me on his evaluation roster. I don't even know that this is a thing until midyear when I asked what the deal was and why I'm not getting any info about it.  This also means I miss the New Teacher Induction orientations and PDs because I was never invited to them, didn't even know they existed.  There is no orientation or anything with regards to district policies, human resources stuff, who to talk to about what, nothing.  Luckily, peers are awesome and basically answer my 1 million questions.

Year 2: I am finally on track to be evaluated, I'm in ""the system"" and I can attend school based PD, but not the NTIs because I'm no longer ""new"".  I eventually push back that and attend some of them. 
Also, this year, I am scheduled to be evaluated, evaluations are generally completed in October/November.  I know this now because I found the Union Handbook buried on its website.  There are 3 observations with multi-week periods of time in between to reflect, refine, and show growth.
The principal goes on injury leave in February. My first observation occurs March 30.  My last observation occurs in April. My observations scores are middling (mostly developing and effective), but my students also failed to meet the SLO that I set, based on the goal that I wrote in the fall that my Principal did not look at before approving it because there was only an informal pre-eval meeting.  The SLO I submitted was ultimately based on samples from general ed classrooms... I haven't gotten to the classes where we talk about valid assessments ESL students, and I don't even know what I can and can't use yet.    My final score is ""ineffective"" which means I am to go on a Personal Improvement Plan.   Evaluator tells me she massaged the numbers ""for me"", whilst also mentioning how much paperwork goes into a PIP.  I tell them that I would prefer getting the support if I need it, which I know I do.   I know that I'm not great at classroom management.  This years class was extra tough and I struggled, but I also would say that I am pretty proactive when it comes to asking for help when I need it, from my team, the social psych staff, my mentor... and from those people, I got great support. Beyond that, the general message from admin was to deal with it in the classroom, but students would not be removed and ""babysat"".

Today - Day 10 of Year 3.  (Recovered) Principal walks in this morning, a few people milling around near the mailboxes, and says ""starlitstarlet, I need to talk to you about some shit.""  Verbatim.   He then sits me down and changes his tone to totally sincere and supportive and rattles off these platitudes about how he knows I'm a hard worker, knows we're all new at some point, blah blah blah... And I'm here for you and I'll give you the support you need. This man has said about five sentences to me in the past 2 years, and most of them were critical in nature.   

And then, because I truly am blessed, the copier jammed while the substitute teacher was using it and I tried to help her and ended up being the last person out to pick up my class (but not late, classes were still caravaning in), and he just says, ""See, this is what I'm talking about, organizational skills.""  I am usually one of the first teachers out to relieve the morning duty people. 

SOOOOoooo basically, I'm feeling pretty pissed off because I actually think I'm pretty fucking good at being held accountable and holding my self accountable, and I have done nothing but like, do my due diligence and BEYOND, and now I'm in this situation where I feel like if I push back and challenge the evaluation (which I have been advised to do by some), or defend myself in any way, I'm going to sound like I'm not interested in improving and just want to blame other people for my bad score.

However, they said that since he wouldn't be moving classrooms we aren't going to go through the IEP/diagnosis process. They all keep telling me that I have been making accommodations in my classroom for him since the beginning of the school year and there isn't much more than the process would give him, but I just fear that if he were to change schools or have a teacher that isn't as accommodating, he may not get all the help he needs. Also, I just feel like knowing will help his parents make appropriate decisions as he develops further. This has kept me up so many nights and I just feel like I'm failing him.

I have a new (to me) special education teacher who works with me during 5 out of 7 classes a day. She has been in the district for over 20 years and is plenty old enough to be my mother. I have worked with a handful of other special education teachers during my career and she is the first where problems have come up. 

So first and foremost she doesn't do her job. Our team taught classes are over 50% special Ed students and she does nothing to support them. She does not help me plan. She does not help me grade. She does not provide any accommodations or modify assignments. All the the support the students have received has been from me or has been the result of me giving her very explicit directions on which students to work with and how. Instead, she comes into the room, sits down, and goes on her computer. She does not always interact with the students and when she does she tends to talk over me and be more disruptive to the lesson than the students. 

I have caught her several times doing students' work for them. I mean their entire assignment was completed in her hand writing, and none of the students have scribe as an IEP accommodation. I have spoken to her about this a few times and she always reverts back to doing their work. 

She also does not make an effort to build relationships. She is quick to yell at students and focuses on the negatives. She yelled at a student for being disrespectful without prompting. Today, I head her tell the students that the assignment was too herd for them and that they can't do it.

On top of all of this she takes lessons that I've created and submits them to administration as her own. These are lessons she had no part of creating and did not know where coming until she stepped into the classroom.

I could go on and on, but I don't want to rant too much. Anyway, had anyone delt with a similar situation or have any advice on what to do? I would like to keep our relationship positive since I still have half a school year with her, but I am losing my mind trying to deal with her.

We have already worked on goal setting.  My next step toward grit will be making commitments to themselves and sticking to them. In their journals, I'm going to have them commit to something that is a challenge for them and stick to it (we'll track it) . We will discuss what they can do when they are not successful and how to redouble their efforts to keep the needle moving forward. I will discuss personal examples. We'll talk about character. I even think there is a short video by the kid President I can show.

 I have been working very hard to set them up for their future selves,  future struggles,  future goals,  really maximizing my effectiveness in the year I have them.

 They have already transformed so much. I had students who came to me as runners (elopers),  some with major character flaws, and many with self-doubt. They are now hard workers, accomplishing more than others expect (so I've been told, which is a little ridiculous to me-their expectations should be higher then, especially because our population is made up of kids whose lives are unstable), and most importantly, the kids are kind to one another,  helpful, empathetic, and calm (well behaved too,  but what I mean is an inner peace). Because of this,  we accomplish a lot. The lessons are so rigorous and the discussions are deep and thoughtful. 

I am very proud of how far they have come. I have to always ask though, what's next?

The long and short of it is, I believe the title 1 job will help me get the experience schools are looking for at a great school that I have researched and met with administration whom I can picture myself working with.

In about 2 weeks, I'll begin my very first year of teaching. I'll be a Special Education teacher in the Resource Room for grades 5 and 8. I'll be pulling out/pushing in. 


I have never worked in a Resource Room and have no idea what kinds of things I should be preparing before school starts. What should the first day of school look like? Getting to know you activities obviously sound great, and setting up expectations/rules for the class, but how soon should I start the ""real"" work? 


What should my classroom look like? Decorations? Behavioral reinforcement ideas? What the best way to collect and store data for IEPs? 


Also, my school is a Spanish Immersion school and the majority of my students are Latino and many are English Language Learners. This is great! I'm Latina myself. However, I do not speak fluent Spanish and just about everyone I work with (teachers and kids) all do. I worry about being taken less seriously for not being as ""in touch"" with my culture. I do speak/understand a decent amount, but I have an accent and sound obviously like I'm learning the language. I worry how this will make me come off to my middle schoolers. 


I want to sign up for one Spanish conversation at the city college. Not only is this a practical skill to have, but it'll help me in my career, and to understand my own culture. Plus, the class is free at my city college. But I worry I might be taking on a lot for my first year of teaching?

I could fold the page I taught vertically into two, for example, but that won't work because half of each page will fall off after 6 months of folding and unfolding. A folded corner triangle wouldn't work either because it would eventually become too ambiguous. And I don't want to start attaching things to the book which would keep falling off every time I take it out my bag.

I've taught for almost 8 years and truly love what I do. My kids are fantastic and make teaching such a joy. But... its all of the other administrative stuff that is just killing me. This is heartbreaking for me to admit it... From unrealistic and unhealthy workloads (teaching 7 back to back 30 minute classes without going to the bathroom) to a lack of consistency with behavior plans (10 year olds throwing chairs at colleagues with minimum punishment), it's becoming a negative impact on my health.

 I just don't know if this is what I want to do for 20-30 years if this is what I am expected to experience.

I've tried many semi successful solutions but I'm at the point where I think this particular school, perhaps even the profession is not a healthy path for me.

Am I crazy?,"I'm sorry in advance for the wall of text. I just need some people with more life experience and different perspectives to give me their advice.

I am a young teacher, this is my 5th year in my own classroom. I'm having a hard time finding where I'm happiest teaching. I taught in an inner-city, very low income, Catholic school. 30 second graders, low resources, no breaks during the day, and all those trials and troubles. I was also in grad school, taking 1-2 classes at a time, while teaching. At the end of last school year, I decided that I was done. I couldn't do it anymore. 

So this year I took a long-term sub position in a public school in a ""good school district.""  15 first graders, every resource you could want, union mandated breaks, the works. This is the school that everyone gave me envious looks when I said I was teaching there. When I started, I was happy. Now, I'm bored, and I've been entertaining the idea of returning to teach in the city (not the same school as before) when this placement is up.

Am I crazy? Go ahead. Give me all the advice, criticism, and support you have. Thanks all!

1520562440,teaching,NLLumi,self.teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/833ait/intense_tutoring_leading_to_nothing/,3,0,,,Intense tutoring leading to nothing,"I started tutoring this kid about two weeks ago. He’s 14, an 8th grader, and I was originally told he wanted to go transfer to some upscale science-focused school in the Haifa region (that’s in Israel), which entails an admission test. Then I came to meet him and got the impression he was all in all pretty bright kid, even if he was not up to speed with the level expected from him.

Soon, however, it turned out that he didn’t know stuff he should have learned in elementary. Things like multiplying and dividing fractions, let alone adding fractions, turned out to be beyond him. Over time it turned out finding a common denominator was, too, as that involves factorizing integers, which involves a good enough command of the multiplication board for division. Seriously, often I have to ask him e.g. to calculate 3×8, and he says, ‘...16+16... 32!’ and only corrects himself when I point out that’s wrong. Today it turned out he didn’t even know how to do long multiplication; I wouldn’t think of trying long _division_ with him.

His level of English (which he is also to be tested on) also quickly turned to be appalling. At first I tried teaching him the difference between present simple and present progressive, but it turned out he couldn’t even conjugate the English verb ‘to be’ or knew what it was used for. After a short while it turned out he didn’t even know the ABC by heart—whenever we switch from practising math to English, he voluntarily starts with going over the ABC, and he always forgets a few letters: the ones between K and M/O, the ones between R and V/W. Today was the first time he managed to remember the names of the letters H and Q: the latter he had been consistently bewildered by even when looking at the letters in order. And this is before we’ve begun talking about things like digraphs, which he repeatedly gets wrong (‘How do you pronounce &lt;ch&gt;?’ ‘[[ʂ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_retroflex_fricative)]’; this is not a consonant that appears in Hebrew), let alone lax and tense vowels, reading, and certainly writing.

Judging by what he says, he was put in a ‘small class’ (a common euphemism here for ‘remedial/special ed class’) for no justifiable reason. He says the atmosphere is very detrimental to learning: students are consistently absent, teachers don’t give a shit, when they give them tests they give them the answers or at least the questions well in advance and often give them the answers during the test (either by telling them directly or writing them on the board). His father adds that the kid is too embarrassed to tell me his schoolmates are actually violent, towards him specifically, and he’s afraid to go to school (he’s even mentioned his schoolmates using drugs), but when this is brought to the school authorities all they do is side with the bullies and recommend that the kid receive therapy, a diagnosis for some learning disability or another (or more than one), or even psychiatric help, instead of actually dealing with the problem.

I haven’t seen how they teach them there myself, and I occasionally wonder just how much of what they’re saying is meant to cover for the severity kid’s own legitimate issues, but today the kid showed me the kinds of tests they get in class: in an English test, they were asked to translate basic words like pronouns in the nominative to Hebrew, and connect the right noun or proper noun to the right pronoun (it turned out he had no idea what the word ‘it’ meant, which makes some sense, as Hebrew has grammatical gender and gendered pronouns for all nouns); this is pretty much 3rd or 4th grade material over here. In a test given in a class about Jewish culture, he was asked to define the term ‘polygamy’ (Hebrew uses a cognate of the English term as a loanword); he wrote just ‘3 and more’ and his answer was marked correct.

He also told me his teacher had taught his class to pronounce English words and phrases with redundant /h/ sounds, and told them that neglecting to use it would make them incomprehensible to native English speakers. After two years of this, it took me forever to get him to stop pronouncing _an apple_ as _han happle_ (and, today, to distinguish between _it_ and _hit_) and it got me so furious I asked him to record me saying in English (and I quote from memory), ‘Listen, retard, I can tell you in my capacity as a native English speaker that the phrase “an apple” is not, in fact, pronounced “han happle”. You are NOT going to teach my student to talk like an idiot Cockney social climber. If you cannot teach English properly, I suggest, I _highly recommend_, that you resign your position effective immediately […]’ He claims that he played it in the beginning of class, in front of everyone (although his classmates were busy with their phones and didn’t notice), and she just left the classroom to cry, returned briefly, then left again, and hasn’t returned since (though he says she might just be absent for unrelated reasons); I highly suspect he’s lying, though, and never actually played the recording. (At any rate, my intention was to ultimately shame her into leaving, or at the very least highlighting her glaring lack of qualification for the job, which would ultimately get her canned.)

On top of it all, his parents are divorced, and his mother is apparently indifferent towards him and his siblings: his father says he’s had to effectively raise them on his own. During today’s lesson the kid appeared to be very tired and not very attentive, even borderline aggressive (ramping up his tendency to say ‘how should I know’ before bothering to do some calculation or another); his father blamed it on the kid visiting his mother the day before, the kid said it was because he hadn’t slept properly the night before and because of his severe gum inflammation. I tried to teach him the word ‘chill’ (to demonstrate the digraph &lt;ch&gt;) as a segue to explaining the phrase ‘Netflix and chill’ to him, as a Hail Mary to get his 14-year-old mind engaged; it barely got a chuckle out of him. The only thing that got him engaged (and laughing his arse off) was showing me the aforementioned tests and watching my horrified reaction of despair. I’m starting to wonder just how much of a point the school authorities have regarding emotional issues. (As a matter of fact, his father has claimed that the kid used to know the multiplication board by heart before the issues with his mother and his school.)

Now the thing is, ultimately, it turns out his brain is practically a sieve. I can teach him to factorize numbers, and he’ll practise and retain it for a little while, and forget all of it almost immediately afterwards. After reviewing over and over how adding fractions work, he would shortly after try to do it by writing the sum of all numerators over the sum of all denominators as the answer, completely missing the point of finding a common denominator. I can teach him over and over what prime numbers are, only for him to forget it within ten minutes. In English, I can teach him over and over what the digraphs &lt;ch&gt;, &lt;sh&gt;, and &lt;th&gt; mean (at this point I can’t even dream of explaining &lt;ugh&gt;), and (as mentioned above) he will be able to read a specific digraph when practised individually and retain that skill for a very short period of time. So far, after 1.5 hour long lessons on a nearly daily basis, I believe the only things he’s managed to retain are:

* how to multiply and divide fractions (I hope);
* how to tell if a number is odd or even;
* that _one_ of the digraphs &lt;ch&gt;, &lt;sh&gt;, or &lt;th&gt; makes a sound that at least sounds like [/ʃ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_fricative);
* that when you multiply an odd number by an odd number, the result would be odd, but if you multiply an even number by either an odd or an even one it would be even (I hope—I’ve gone over this with him over and over);
* that &lt;c&gt; is pronounced /s/ before certain letters (not sure if he remembers which ones); and
* _that it’s not fucking pronounced ‘han happle’_.

I really have no idea what to do. He’s not a dumb kid: he once made the observation that most people don’t truly believe in God, but mostly pay lip service to the idea ‘just in case’ it turns out there was a God all along. I also overheard him arguing with his father and saying, ‘Are you gonna give up on your son’s education?’ He strikes me as insightful and perceptive and fairly articulate, but I don’t know how to get him to retain anything he learns. I don’t know if it’s genuine learning disabilities (I highly suspect he has dyscalculia, and maybe mild dysgraphia), just emotional problems, a combination of both… (So far he’s seen a psychologist, but they haven’t really told me much about what her conclusions were. Despite my repeated recommendations, the kid has not gone through didactic diagnosis.) It seems that the realization that there’s no way in hell he would be admitted to that school he wanted (if only for the sake of getting out of the current shithole he attends now) has taken a toll on his motivation, even though he realizes on a cognitive level that he needs to learn anyway to at least get somewhere else, or to advance in life anyway. The fact he doesn’t practise the material I go over with him is also an issue (even after I told his father to go and get textbooks for him; today he finally bothered to try but couldn’t find any at the one bookstore he went to), but considering how quickly he forgets information and how frequent my lessons with him are, I’m not entirely sure how much of a difference that would make. (In general, I’m slowly getting the impression his father is more than willing to throw money at the problem, paying for an exorbitant amount of private lessons, without putting much of an actual effort into it—this is really puzzling, as they seem _very_ working class to me. I have no idea how he can afford it.)

What can I do about it? I feel like I am, as they say here, ‘grinding water’.

Some background: I just got my MAT in Secondary Science from a school in PA, after already getting my bachelors in science. I will have my PA cert in about three weeks. Since May I have also filled out applications to about 90 jobs from all over the country and have only had 3 interviews. I have moved around many times in my life and am 100% willing to move anywhere in the US (or internationally, potentially).

So here are my questions I have for everyone, any feedback on any of these would be appreciated:

1) Am I at a disadvantage for having my Masters instead of just a Bachelors due to the pay difference?

2) Do you have any advice on how to make myself stand out to employers? I have some experience doing research which I have highlighted, as well as my year-long student teaching placement, but not much else.

3) I know I'm pretty much screwed at this point for applying for jobs in states that start school in early/mid august due to certification time constraints- should I just ignore those states completely and just focus on PA and states that start in late august/early September?

4) I'm set on high school, but I'd rather teach middle school than be unemployed. When should I give up on my only high school search and start looking at middle school?

5) If I don't get a full teaching position by the start of the school year I will probably sub. Do I have any other options as last-ditch jobs I could do this year that would look good to employers for the next year?

My certification will be in Idaho, though I'm not planning to teach there. However, I have received high enough scores on my single subject praxis tests to teach in any state. I'll likely apply to schools in Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and maybe Oregon and Washington.

My main concern/question is in regards to how long the hiring process usually takes. I'm not too picky about what school I end up in, as I'm of the opinion that any experience is good experience when you're starting out.

My tentative plan is to take professional development classes during my last semester to boost my resume and try to network a bit. I do have one connection for two school districts in Utah, with the potential for connections in Nevada and maybe Washington. I'm also planning on giving a portfolio to my Student Teaching placement with the request that they keep me in mind for any upcoming open positions.

Also: a little disclaimer. I did receive a misdemeanor of Disturbing the Peace my freshmen year of college. I've never had fingerprints taken and I've passed all the background checks for getting into the programs, but I'm not sure if that's worth anything.

I taught her when she first arrived, but (typically) we were given no warning of her arrival, nor any information about how much of the language she could understand. She was given a few sessions of English lessons per week, but of course the rest of the teaching staff have been clueless about her progress.

The girl was placed in a very challenging class, which meant it was difficult to devote enough time to her as I would've liked, and once the novelty wore off her classmates were reluctant to help her. She was frequently absent so sometimes plans I had would go to waste. In the end, I'm afraid to say that I kind of had to give up on her.

I've found out I have her again - the class has been split up so hopefully it will be better. Obviously I don't want to end up like I did last year - I know it's my duty to support her but I just don't know how. This will be my second year of teaching, I haven't had any training in EAL, and my experience has been with students that already have a good grasp of the English language.

She is quiet and rarely speaks, other than scripted phrases like please, thank you and can I go to the toilet. She seems to understand basic instructions, but relies heavily on non-verbal cues and honestly looks clueless a lot of time.

How am I meant to teach her the curriculum? How do I adapt tasks for her? I've considered writing out task instructions in English and Romanian (using Google translate...), but don't know how she will be able to complete most of the tasks I can think of setting her. 

Who else has experience of this? Any advice/tips?

My mom has been fighting cancer for the past 2 years and this past month, it spread to her brain. She was taken to the ER and I was called out of school to go visit her. This started a long break of time  where I didn't go to school. When trying to figure out what to do, my principal told me I could 

1. Try to get FMLA
2. Burn through all my personal days 
3. Quit

I went with option 1, but my school has a policy that I have to work there for a year before I could get FMLA, so I went with option 2. They wanted me to come back as soon as my personal days were out, (which was on a friday) but I persisted that I go back the following Monday.

 That Friday, my mom passed. I got bereavement for a couple of days but as soon as I got back, they slam me with news that during this ordeal, they found out I had been living with my girlfriend and that, since this was a Catholic school, I would eventually have to choose between keeping my job or moving out with my girlfriend. 

This week has been hard but I knew it was the right thing to do to quit because I couldn't effectively teach without the support from admin. I never even got any flowers or a card. I just got an ultimatum. The VP told everyone to not do anything for me until I had asked them to do so. It sucks because I really cared about those kids and I've been their first male teacher experience (they're in 2nd grade) but it didn't seem like I really had a choice.

I say this all to ask: is it really like this at other schools? I love teaching and I love working with kids but if it's going to be like this at most schools, I'm thinking that I want to reconsider my career.

Thanks for reading this.

So my situation is that I'm in my final year of my bachelor teacher biology. I love teaching in the sense that I love explaining subjects. Helping kids understand certain (difficult) topics and I think I'm rather good at that. The problem arises when I should be the leader of a classroom.

I am no leader. And it takes so, so much energy to try and be one. I have difficulties giving discipline, punishing misbehaviour and rewarding good behaviour. It also feels like I'm just trying to condition these kids and I really hate doing that.

There are some other aspects but I won't go into it right now.

Dropping out isn't an option because I really need a degree, my students debt is quite high you see. The Dutch system is designed in a way that your debt is lower if you finish your education.

I really don't see how I'm going to pull through this year and how I'm actually going to finish my bachelor.

I'm in my third year of teaching 5th grade reading, and although I feel that I'm slowly but surely getting better at my job, I'm still struggling with one particular aspect of it: unrealistically high expectations set upon teachers in terms of scores.  This is part rant and part request for advice.  I'm hoping some of you can give me some perspective on this, and some reading/writing tips wouldn't hurt either.  :)

The primary thing that bugs me about teaching reading in the 5th grade is scores.  Whenever my students take the monthly progress monitoring test (the STAR test, which is simply a timed multiple-choice test where they read short passages and answer questions about them), the results are pored over by the administration and the superintendent, and I am held accountable to those scores (i.e. chewed out if the scores aren't high enough).  If a student scores well, I'm lauded; conversely, if a student scores poorly, I am the sole recipient of the blame.  The students themselves are not held accountable for their scores, and are passed along to the next grade regardless of their ability.  I get students who can't spell, who don't know their Fry words, and who read on a 2nd grade level, yet I'm expected to get them up to speed and ready for the middle school in 9 months.

While I understand that accountability is important, I feel it is unrealistic to base a teacher's worth on a multiple choice test that can't truly and completely measure how well a student can read.  I know several of my students who can read very well but test very poorly, or students who don't give an ounce of effort, or are just having a bad day on test day, yet they aren't held responsible for their performance.  The terminology they use is also indicative of the way they view scores.  It's never about how well the student did, it's always phrased as how well **I** did, or how poorly **I** scored.  I even think about them as ""my scores"" now.

It's even worse when it comes to the end-of-the-year test.  In that case, we have an entire day devoted to publicly displaying the results from each tested area.  Most of the other teachers' scores are lumped together in one grade-level score.  For the intermediate teachers, though, our scores are singled out and criticized in front of the entire staff.  And considering that the STAR test only measures a small portion of what the end-of-year test measures, the scores are typically far worse than during the year.

I realize that I am not the best teacher and that I can always improve, but the obsession over scores is just driving me up the wall.  I become a nervous wreck when a test is coming up (I have one this week, and I really don't even want to go in that day).  When the scores aren't as high as expected, I feel like I'm an awful teacher and I doubt my choice of profession.

Am I blowing this all out of proportion?  Is it really entirely my fault that my students aren't scoring higher?  Or is it a larger, systemic problem that we focus on test scores at the expense of everything else?  I fear that my only choice is to just take my lumps and keep going, but it's getting so disheartening and demotivating that I don't even want to try.",,7iww4f,,0,,false,1515313453,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7iww4f/unrealistic_expectations_in_teaching/,,,,,

I recently graduated, got certified and became a substitute. I went to my first assignment and it was for two days -- it turns out they need me for much longer and I will be doing this assignment for 2 more months. 

This class in particular has not had a teacher or substitute since November. They have primarily been getting split up and placed with other classes everyday and been handed a packet of worksheets everyday. There is a massive teaching shortage.

Due to this - their behavior is off the walls. Understandable and I can level with it completely. Another issue is - I have no idea whatsoever to plan for them. No idea where they are in terms of curriculum. No idea of the levels of the different students in the classroom. I've been giving them busy work the past two days I subbed for them. I think that's also adding to the terrible behavior issues.

I will go back next week to substitute for the next few months. Here are my questions - am I out of line to e-mail the principal and ask politely for a direction of how to plan? Should I wait until I'm there and try to collaborate with neighboring teachers? I'm a brand new teacher and walking into this was a shock to say the least. I do not want to come across as rude to the principal - but I really need to know more about these students.

So next year I will be coaching JV volleyball at the school I teach at. I was a volleyball player in high school and college, and coached about ten years ago, only for a club season. I took the position because there was no one else to do it, but to be honest, I’m not super excited about coaching. 

I’ve been out of the game for about 10-15 years, and I’m wondering how other coaches balance teaching with the commitment of coaching. I’m also wondering if anyone has any resources that might help with this. I know I only plan on coaching this year, but I still want to do well, but without sacrificing my mental health in the process. 

Any advice would be helpful. ",,8oejs3,,0,,false,1536331257,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/8oejs3/teaching_and_coaching_need_some_help/,,,false,,

Instead of just collaborating with other science teachers in a PLC I will be expected to lead the meetings and I guess make the final decisions on some things.

Option two, study guide test on the day before( or two days before). Basically I make a study guide for the test and go over it in class.

I'm in my first year of teaching, and we've just started our second quarter in my district. If you'd talked to me two weeks ago, I would've told you my life was perfect.

My experience with TFA, thus far, has been far from perfect. I haven't gotten the support I was promised. My instructional coach (IC) who is supposed to be my mentor throughout my two years in TFA, is non-communicative and fails to get back to me when I reach our for help, but I had developed a great community at my placement school. I was teaching ELA and social studies in 5th grade, and I felt like a rockstar teacher. I had passion for and knowledge of my subjects, and I truly enjoyed teaching. That coupled with the fact that my school and my students were mostly Latinx (as am I) allowed me to develop an amazing culture in my classroom, where my students and I shared a similar background and I was able to imbue in them passion for the subjects I taught. 

However, less than a week before the end of the first quarter, I found out I was being excessed/surplussed from my school. Our enrollment was low, and as the newest teacher, I was the one told to leave. (I would like to add that, prior to this, my principal told the new teacher mentors at my school to tell all new teachers that she wasn't going to excess new teachers, so this came as a complete shock) My principal was kind enough to set me up with a new position at a different school, still teaching 5th grade, but flipping content to math and science. 

I tried to take this in stride, but I am not coping well. I think about my former students every single day. I'm a 22-year-old in a new city, and the entire community I built here was at my old school with those teachers and students and families. Now, I feel as though I've lost my community in this city. I feel angry that my principal misled me, and that Teach For America has offered absolutely no support. I'm devastated at losing the students I worked so hard to teach and build a community with. Most of my kids said I was the only Mexican teacher they'd ever had, and I was the first teacher they'd ever had who pronounced their names correctly. We bonded over shared culture and traditions and food. 

It was just another punch in the gut to have to switch content. I liked teaching reading, but I had such a passion for teaching social studies. My students told me regularly that they hated social studies before I taught it to them, and that gave me so much joy. I truly loved teaching those kids about history. Our curriculum covered from the Civil War to Vietnam, and I was truly excited to teach them about all the amazing, terrible, tragic, and incredible things that have happened in our country and in our world throughout that time period, and now I don't get to do that. 

At my new school, I feel ostracized and set up to fail. I've tried reaching out to my new team, but to no avail. They don't seem to want anything to do with me. We had a field trip last week that they didn't tell me about (it was planned before I was transferred to this school), so I had no idea what to do logistics-wise with my students who were going and for the ones who were staying behind. 

Also, teaching math and science is just not my forte. They aren't subjects I have any passion for. I try to teach them to the best of my ability, but my students can see I don't love division or motion, so there's no point for them to love it either. Not to mention, our math curriculum is ridiculous, and it has a steep learning curve for teachers. I didn't receive any training for it during training because I was teaching ELA and social studies. 

My relationship with my students is also so different. I'm teaching a different demographic now, and that shared cultural connection upon which I'd built a relationship with my old students just isn't there. I'm having trouble connecting with my new students, and it's affecting the way I'm teaching them. The students I taught during the summer with TFA were also from a different demographic than my first group of fifth graders, and I didn't have trouble connecting with them, so I don't know what's stopping me from connecting with my new students, but I just can't get past that block and it's hurting all of us. 

I'm also not used to dealing with behavioral issues. My old students were incredible, and the biggest issue I ever had was too much talking. Now I'm dealing with students who hit and antagonize each other, who refuse to work because they don't care, who scream and yell and throw things, and I don't know how to address it, and no one is helping me. My homeroom doesn't have these issues, but my partner's class does, and she says they don't have those problems with her so she can't help me. I don't understand how to get them invested because it was so easy with my old students, and now I'm floundering. (I'd like to note that I did deal with issues during the summer, but a second grader refusing to do her work because she's frustrated is a far different animal than a fifth grader refusing to do his work because he doesn't like you).

I've even reached out to the principal for help, and she either doesn't reply to my emails, or she says she will get back to me later and never does. I honestly don't know what to do. I loved teaching when I was at my old school, but now after only two weeks, I feel beaten down and tired and sad and I don't know how much longer I can do this job with fidelity. No one within TFA has been helpful. No one at my new school has been helpful. All my mentors from university have told me to quit, and I am really considering it. I even applied to a new job back in my home state, and I'm willing to break my lease to move back if I have to. I just want to be happy again, and I don't know how to get there.

Perhaps this is a silly question, but I'm a student teacher and haven't seen this situation before so was looking for some second opinions. Can you differentiate summative assessment between classes? 

As for further details, due to programming at the school, one of my (three) classes ended up with only 2 lessons to prepare new content for a summative assessment. Of course, I asked for an extension, but my supervising teacher has denied it claiming I taught the content poorly and they would have been okay if they were in control of the class. I disagree, but that is beside the point. Instead, they have told me to write differentiated papers for the three different classes, one of which emits a whole section of the question, which then means one aspect of the assessment isn't even being represented. I understand how important differentiation is and there certainly is a difference in ability between these classes, but I thought summative assessment was to meet set benchmarks? One class isn't being tested on one benchmark...

I graduated last year with my bachelors in elementary education and I’m certified and what not, but I’m not currently teaching. I’m working on getting my masters in instructional technology. My big project for the semester in one of my courses is to design a classroom wiki page for a unit and to include elements of a flipped/blended classroom. This is an online class, and having read the lectures, there doesn’t seem to be much structure to the assignment. I’m assuming this is so it can be adapted at any grade level. 

I’ve decided to adapt a 5th grade reading/writing unit about reading informational texts and writing research essays. So far I have it set up as kind of a Wikipedia style page, with pages dedicated to the more major/widely known events (Louisiana Purchase, The Gold Rush, etc). My goal for this hypothetical unit is to have the students work together to research a lesser known topic (Fur Trading  or the Transcontinental Railroad, for example) and then publish their own pages on the wiki. 

My question is this: when I look at the rubric for the elements I need to include in this wiki, it says that I need to include four examples of learning in the three domains. I shouldn’t have trouble hitting the cognitive and affective domains, but how can I incorporate the psychomotor domain into this purely online wiki page? 

I would just ask my professor, but I just emailed him and asked how, exactly, I would go about including four ways for 5th graders to interact with the wiki via social media (another element of the rubric), and his answer was to “mine the internet” and find child safe apps or websites I could tie in. I figured I didn’t have to email him to know what his response would be, so I thought I’d start “mining” here. 

Thanks in advance :)

The older kids (4th-6th grade) are on 2 teams that come in at the same time. I count them off 1-4 as they come in to assign them to tables.

Today the 2 older teams could not stop talking and misbehaving. There was 1 kid at table 4 that kept instigating bad behavior with the kid who was sitting next to him. I asked table 4 multiple times to keep it down, in the voice I use normally to get the class's attention. After several warnings, I told table 4 they were well on their way to getting the art project canceled if they kept it up. I noticed 2 girls crying. They were sitting at table 4 and were the only ones behaving. 

I assumed the instigator made them cry, because these girls love art and would hate to miss out on it. I went over and spoke with the instigator 1-on-1. I told him he'd upset his peers and it would not be tolerted. I asked the instigator to go to time out. Where he continued trying to engage the crying girls and the boy at table 4.

That's when one team leader took the crying girls outside. I sat down and wrote a note to my boss about the instigator's behavior. I told the instigator I was writing the note to his parents.

Well, at the end of class my boss and the co-boss are standing outside with the 2 crying girls. I handed my co-boss the note, and my boss came in a few moments later. He asked what happened and I explained. He told me the 2 girls felt I was yelling at them!

I was floored, because that's not at all what I felt happened. I tried to hunt them down after teaching my other 4 classes to apologize, and only found 1. I apologized to her and said I'd sit her away from the instigator tomorrow.

I could just say ""good morning"" and she shuts off.  I'm flying solo now without my mentor and that behavior has spread regardless of any type of redirection. I've literally tried every step on my classroom management notes. 

They will no do what I tell them unless the co teacher repeats me. And I'm being loud. I know they hear me. They acknowledge me, laugh and continue to not do anything. They were out of assigned seats (they're there for a reason) and after silent reading I made them go back to their seats. 

Huge tizzy ensued full of ""Mrs. Mentor teacher let's me"". When we both know that isn't true. 

They don't care.

I'm a university student and, since I do my studying after the lessons, I have a lot of free time on the weekend. Plus, it looked like an easy way to get pocket money, so I said ""why not?""

After a chaotic first lesson where I was supposed to ""get the hang of how things worked"", the kid had hit me twice, attempted to put bubblegum in my head, scribbled all over my hand and exercise book and almost broke a couple of my pens, so we basically were able to do nothing productive.

So this is when her mother pays me for the lesson and tells me that his son has ADHD and that normally they give him some medication when he's going to study to ""calm him down"" but she had forgotten to give it to him that day.

The next lessons were a bit better, with the kid not bouncing around the room while we went through his homework, but I got the feeling that he wasn't paying attention at all, as when I explained anything to him he would often just scribble on his page or do whatever instead of he work, so these last lessons (we've only done 5) have been basically me doing his homework for him and talking to a brick wall.

I'd really appreciate if anyone could give me any way to get the kid to actually focus in the lesson and  to do the work instead of me and possibly a way to explain him in a way that he can understand what he's doing (because honestly it looks like he doesn't at all).",,75f9iu,,0,,false,1510417604,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/75f9iu/trouble_with_private_student_with_adhd/,,,,,

I’ve tried to model the process and thinking behind it. Most of them are quite successful when I guide them through it line by line, asking them questions to help break it all down, but then when I say “Okay now try some on your own,” they completely shut down. I would love some ideas as to what I could give them or make available to them to maybe help them familiarize themselves a little more with the language, perhaps make them more confident and comfortable.

I am *thinking*of doing a career change. I am a CPA by profession and have a B. Commerce from Ontario but have always wanted to be a teacher  

My majors are economics and accounting but looming into the Masters of Teaching at OISE, I don't think these two subjects count as teachables?

So I think I'll need to do extra courses. I like Math and I'm thinking maybe social science as my other. 

My questions are..

- does it matter what university you finish your teachable credits from? Uoft vs. Athabasca online 

- does it matter what level of courses you take to cover your teachable subjects? For example I need to take 6 full year courses in Math. Does it matter which ones..if I take 3 first year calculus and 3 second year? Does it matter?

- can I get into OISE Masters of Teaching without a B. Ed? Application asks for experience with learners and reference letters from professors. 

I have TA'd but does that play in my favour?

Is there really a shortage of math teachers and does having math give you an edge in ontario (especially Peel and TDSB)

 Any help much appreciated!!

I'm trying to put together a list of ""stock"" teacher phrases or sentences which I can translate into Spanish, French, and other languages as part of a reference document, and I wanted to know if any of you could help contribute to my list! The idea is to create a document for any given language that I can resort to to get across basic information to students who do not speak English, not as a replacement to but in addition to actually learning the languages myself. The types of phrases I'm thinking of are...

""How are you today?""
""We are studying...""
""The word for ___ is ____""
""Please work by yourself/with a partner.""
""You're doing very well!""
""You should work on...""
etc.

I don't need help with the languages so much as the phrases I should include in these documents. Ideally, I'd like to distribute these documents to some of the other new teachers in my school. What other basic phrases do y'all think could be included?

Thanks! Any and all help is much appreciated.",,7piqsm,,0,,false,1518519677,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7piqsm/teaching_students_in_various_languages/,,,,,

It should have been an easy day for me because we are reviewing for finals and I had a game set up and candy prizes for the winners. 

However in a couple of classes I have some real trouble makers (this is high school). In one of those classes I have one student who has never put pencil to paper in my class, not once. I can usually find her with her cell phone out, smirking at other students, or staring into space with a blank expression. 

The only time this student has completed any work for my class was during a time in ISS when she apparently decided to work, later in ISS she stopped doing any work also. 

Today I had quite the day, 5th period was already being monsters during a fun review game that helped them for their final. So I warned 6th period that even though we were playing a game, we were still following the rules such as not eating in class. Not 5 minutes later I look up and Missy DoNothing is licking something off of her hand dramatically, kind of like she was doing drugs or something in the back of my classroom. I was livid. I asked her what she thought she was doing, she stated that she was eating 'mexican candy'. At this point I had one of my most unprofessional moments as a teacher, I turned bright red I'm certain and I told her in no uncertain terms to go to the office immediately and while she was there she should talk to her counselor and ask to be switched to one of the other teachers that teaches my subject because I was done. 

Now I feel kind of bad because she was just eating in class, I think anyway, it might have been worse and actually been drugs, but I'm pretty sure it was just a very nasty way to eat candy. We do after all have a flu epidemic going on in the US right now and I feel like licking your most likely unwashed hand after sitting at a filthy desk at the end of a long school day is probably not the cleanest thing one could do at school. It makes me cringe just thinking about it, anyway maybe she will switch out of my class and I can move on in life?

We're trying to figure out some stuff about how to plan appropriately. I have three questions:

1) do you know if she works a side job--either during the school year or in the summer--and she pays social security into that, that money *does* count toward her social security yearly contribution, right? (This seems like an obvious yes, but I've learned to take nothing as obvious with U.S. tax laws!)

2) if she does not work long enough as a teacher to get a pension (she currently has to pay into the teacher's pension system), is it correct to say that she will a) get that money back when she leaves being a teacher, and b) when she is retired and claiming social security, she will have no reduction in her social security checks, since she would not be receiving a teacher's pension?

3) she was a teacher before in this pension system, but had withdrawn her pension funds when she left the first time. When does it make sense to buy back previous years, and what are the pros and cons of that?

I'm a language teacher, currently training to be a teacher trainer. My thesis is on how you as language teachers teach foreign students, depending on how well the foreign student speaks the language you teach. 

I'm currently researching how language teachers teach their target language to foreign students who do not speak the language of the country you are in. For example, a Chilean student in the USA who does not speak English.

I'm interested in how, as language teachers, you react to this situation. How does it depend on the student's mastery of the language you teach? (Ex: you teach French, and the Chilean student does not speak it at all and is therefore learning both French and English, or you teach Spanish and your Chilean student is fluent...).

What training do you receive about teaching foreign students, if any? What training would you like to receive? Please say which country you are in, as these things can be country-specific. 

Thank you for your help :-).

I have decided to go into education.   I've built a career in UX design, web/app development, and photography, but I'm ready to switch gears.  I never went to college but now find myself with the opportunity to do so.  I'd like to do something more focused on education, and I want to make an informed decision as to the best way forward.

**What I want to do**
---

---

Specifically, I'm interested in teaching or supporting science through project-based, STEM/STEAM learning, or supporting others in doing so.  I think this would be the most effective from 6th grade through high school.  I'm considering roles like some (or all) of the following:
 
* Technology purchases, installation, and curriculum planning, at school or district levels
* Building/maintaining makerspaces and innovation labs, possibly becoming a librarian with a focus on tech
* Direct instruction of students (though I'm concerned about getting stuck in test prep instead of teaching)

For direct instruction, my goal would be to introduce students to new tech and show them how they can use it to build careers... but without making it all about careers.  I want to teach students to use 3D printers, microcontrollers (Arduino/Pi), laser cutters, etc. to literally build their dreams, and do so in a way that gets them to think about the process rather than just downloading pre-designed fidget spinners from [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/).  If it isn't feasible to do this as a standalone role I'd like to establish programs that empower other teachers to do so during blocks allotted for these activities.  (i.e. establishing specific curriculum surrounding the use and instruction of the tech mentioned previously.)

**What I need from you**
---

---

* Insight into what types of degrees you tend to see filling roles like those above, including but not limited to:
  * Digital Media and Learning
  * Secondary Teacher Ed (CLAS/SEHD/etc.  Are credentials necessary if not directly teaching?)
  * Educational/Instructional Technologies
  * Others?
* Recommendations for any specific Minors, extracurricular activities, or other background I should try to achieve in the next 4-6 years
* Any recommendations you have for specific roles/titles I might have missed or should consider
* Any other advice you may have!  :-)

I sign off that its completed and they can self-evaluate themselves off of an answer key I provide. Once that happens, they can see me for individualized help if they got something wrong.

In essence, I guess this is a mastery of learning kind of thing.

Questions I have for you all who have tried this and succeeded or failed:
1. How do you motivate students to manage their time correctly?
2. How do you evaluate students mastery of the subject?

The MBTI is INCREDIBLY useful when it comes to understanding students, improving communication, teamwork, and learning itself.
I will not deny it has criticisms, but there's misunderstandings surrounding its criticisms as well as its origins, so I'd suggest checking out r/MBTI for help on clearing up misinformation and misconceptions surrounding the MBTI.

It improves communication, improves understanding of students, gives HUGE insight into the workings of each student's mind, informs you on the student's learning style, and more.

While it can be used to keep a person's attention as well, only bits and pieces of that knowledge are useful as there's a more practical solution:
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10321016-pitch-anything
This book explains the science of pitching (we actually do this as a typical everyday act) using neuroscience. It's a one-size-fits-all sort of thing.
There's two more pieces of information I'd suggest checking out: Neuroplasticity and the book Bounce
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7845157-bounce?from_search=true

The reason why I'm posting this is due to personal experience. I had issues in school growing up. It wasn't the fault of any of the teachers. The problem was ignorance (not to be confused with stupidity). I noticed students getting unjustified praise, students lacking justified praise, a lack of interest, false interest (things such as herd mentality occurred in which people thought they found something interesting/felt strongly about something but didn't), reward systems used incorrectly, incorrect usage of punishment and reinforcement, students being labeled as ""dumb"", ""smart"", ""fast learner"", ""slow learner"", ""misbehaved"", ""rebellious"", ""lacking in discipline"", ""disrespectful"", ""having trouble focusing"", etc.
I actually want to be a teacher to help fix this problem.

My vocabulary was limited growing up, so I wasn't able to say what I needed to say. I was limited in the tools I had (knowledge as tools), and I was misinformed.

I hope this doesn't come off as self-promotion. I'm just leaving this link for convenience purposes:
https://thepunnyscientist.blogspot.com/2017/11/8-study-tips-not-mentioned.html

We actually mislabel people as stupid, uncooperative, etc. so often. In reality, we're looking through the lens of our personality type, which is a biased lens. We're naturally biased in some regards. What we have to do is look at certain people through the lens of other personality types, because filtering our type through those personality types filters out the biases.

It's likely many of you are ISTJs while many of you are ESFJs, some being ENFJs and INFJs, and the remaining having other personality types.

If you'd like some more information on the MBTI, forms of meditation, addiction, procrastination, and/or compulsive behavior, I'd be glad to provide it.

However, it then says that you may include a ""a second or third clip"" demonstrating students' understanding of the learning target... Does this mean I can't use this clip if I already plan to submit a third video for my language function or am I reading too much into the language used? Basically, can anyone tell me if I'm able to submit four clips including my two main clips, my language function clip, and my learning target clip? Let me know if I'm not making any sense... Thanks.

Essential

* Produces PDF, Word Doc or other easily/cleanly printable option
* Allows for diagrams in the problems (e.g. a graph, an equation, etc.)

Strongly Desired (trying to hit as much of these as possible)

* Allows for test item bank (can store a bunch of questions to pull from for a given test)
* Allows for tests to be saved to be edited later (i.e. can login or download)
* Allows both multiple choice and free response questions

Nice but not highly important

* Free
* Preexisting test bank (for GCSE/IGCSE questions)
* Analytics capabilities
* Custom formatting

Unnecessary (these wouldn't be used and would not help to have)

* Options to TAKE tests online
* ""Fun"" extra test modes (i.e. just need ""normal"" standardized tests)

I'm happy to do research, but if I had some directions to run, it would be much appreciated :)

I'm not a fan of these standardized tests, but since students take them at the end of the year, we want to give them at least a few practices and I've been trying to find ways to streamline the preparation of them.

Because of this selective conservation, ecosystems continue to move towards collapse due to unbalanced biodiversity.

My proposed solution is a video game that gamifies education and engagement in biology and ecology. The game will be a resource-management and environment-building style game, such as SimCity or Zoo Tycoon. When the player begins the game, they undertake an ecosystem with a poorly balanced environment and limited resources. The objective of the game is to restore this balance with the resources on hand and achieve ecosystem equilibrium through efficient species management. Or instead, if users choose, they can intentionally destroy the environment. Either way, they’ll learn what does and doesn’t work.

So, my questions are, would you find something like a useful engagement and education tool? Why and why not? At what age should children be exposed to digital learning tools vs tangible, traditional learning through books, etc.

Hope you're all mentally preparing for all of the terrifying ""It"" costumes this year! (I know I am). I am a high school 2nd year English teacher and I've come up against some struggles. I taught middle school last year and the beginning of this year. After about three weeks, they told me enrollment was down and transferred me to the local high school. I haven't taught high school since I was a student teacher and it has been a difficult process. This is made exceptionally more difficult by an alternating 86 minute block schedule where I see the kids only 2-3 times a week, based on the day. Even period days I have one English class of Sophomores with 3 free/prep periods. And Odd days I have a 9th grade Reading Improvement, 10th grade AVID and two section of English with no prep period (these days suuuuuck).
 
I've gotten slightly used to the schedule and switching to high school, but I'm in a bit of a pickle. I normally do PATs every other Friday as an incentive for good class behavior and my normal consequence system is 1)warning 2)Detention 3) Call home 4) Meet with counselor.

Now here's my problem/ where I need to talk through my problems. I'm not allowed to keep kids all of lunch or snack (no more than ~3 minutes) and they won't show up if it's after/before school (either forgot or ditched). We're not allowed to give referrals unless we've warned/called home. Most calls are unanswered or unhelpful at this point (lots of rough homes). I feel like I was too easy in the beginning because I was just trying to figure out what the heck was going on. PAT seems unhelpful on a block schedule and my consequences are hard to reinforce and seem unfitting.

Now, I LOVE my kids. I have some rough ones, but I try to build rapport and get to know them. When I talk to them or keep them after, they seem to understand what's up. Generally, they listen and are getting better at homework after lots of pushing and working. However, they cannot be quiet. It might be because I'm still/look young, it might be because I don't know how to adapt to high school/ consequences yet, it could be because block schedule absolutely sucks. Anyways, any helpful tips on how to manage a Sophomore class, actually have USEFUL consequences and how to stay consistent when there are 32 of them and 1 of me. I feel like I know what to do, but I just don't do it? I'm not sure....

But it seems like this makes me a monster to many people. Apparently, I should want to teach in inner-city title I schools, I should be doggedly passionate about dismantling racism, and I should be willing to sacrifice my own desires and well-being in pursuit of social justice.

I don't really get this. Teachers at these types of schools are certainly altruistic, but they also often seem profoundly unhappy, chronically stressed, disrespected, and burned out. 

If a business consultant landed a job at Google, most people wouldn't berate him and say that he should instead work as a consultant for small businesses in struggling, inner-city neighborhoods; if a doctor wanted to work at a well-regarded, esteemed hospital, most people wouldn't say that she should instead work at a run-down clinic.

It’s what I’ve always wanted to do, I just happened to get a job in MS. I’m also dreading the thought of ever being put in a 6th grade class or ever teaching majority 7th grade again which is likely because people get moved grades frequently. 

Is it bad to transfer after only 2 years? Will I offend my principal? He went to bat for me to get this job in the first place and I quite like him but honestly it’s not the building, it’s the age group.

I've noticed I'll have difficulty learning certain things (e.g. politics) because of confusion over terminology and misinformation on what certain words and concepts are. For example, ""scheme"", ""anarchy"", etc. As a result, I'd often get confused when trying to learn certain things. I thought anarchy was absolutely bad and was rebellion against government or was a country without a government. It's not that simple. I thought schemes were always bad, because they're virtually always used in a negative context. It's not that simple.

This can be applied to psychology to. ""Ego"" has been used in a negative context so much that people think it's bad. In actuality, everyone has an ego. It's a major part of the mind. When it becomes unhealthy, that's when problems occur.

I've figured out how to fix this now. I question my definitions of terms. Prior to this, people would look at me like I was an idiot or as if the subject was too difficult for me. That wasn't the problem. The problem was I was misinformed on so many terms and concepts, resulting in confusion. I was trying to put everything together in a big interconnected web, but since I was misinformed on so many terms and concepts, what I'd say would seem way out there. Once I fixed my definitions of terms and concepts, everything become much clearer.

I just thought this was worth noting. It's not always that students are slow learners nor dumb nor that the subject is too hard for them. It's that they're trying to put things together with faulty definitions and misinformation.",,80ohja,,0,,false,1520604544,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/80ohja/difficulty_learning_certain_subjects_and/,,,,,

Do I stand a chance of getting into a good PGDE without an honours degree? 

Some background: Currently I am an undergrad at a Scottish university deciding whether or not to leave university with an ordinary degree (Bsc) or stay on and complete my full honours. I'm going to apply to PGDE programmes after graduating with the hope of becoming a chemistry teacher. 

Reasons to leave: I have been teaching english language in different countries for years and I have completed a classroom assistant initiative in a Scottish school. And as a result of this I have a lot of experience and a collection of glowing references. I love to teach and want to get into the thick of it asap. 

Being in university is difficult for my partner who is unable to build his career without knowing which city we need to be in or what kind of support I can offer financially/ domestically. They have been so supportive and I want to do what is best for them. 

Another reason is that I genuinely want to leave the current course that I am studying. I am not as young as my contemporaries and that can be quite isolating. I am of an age where staying out till 6am and rocking up to classes still drunk just really isn't for me. 

What I am studying is really valuable and interesting. But I feel like the course is less an education in the subject matter and more of a job training programme for a specific field of work/ research. Which is valid, just not for me. the very strict composition of the course leaves no room for any academic freedom or exploration and that doesn't gel with the type of person that I am. 

Also less debt.

Reasons to stay: There are already multiple PGDE programmes that have explicitly stated that they want upper second class honours for entry. So I'm already dramatically decreasing my chances of getting into one. 
If I ever wanted to leave education i'd find that I have less opportunity in the field that my degree is in. 

I am lucky enough to be in a university that has a dissertation option focussed in science communication( particularly to younger audiences) which is ideal when you want to communicate science to younger audiences.

I have tried looking it up online, but all I can find are articles on petty behaviour issues (like not handing in homework, or blurting out). I'm generally pretty good at handling students who occasionally misbehave. A threat to send them to the office is usually enough if it gets really bad, especially at nicer schools, but it rarely even gets to that point.

On the other hand, I spend the majority of my time at a very high needs school because they constantly have teachers out. An issue I've had is students that don't listen. And I don't mean they're not following instructions. I've gotten much better about making my instructions crystal clear. I mean students who are completely and unapologetically *ignoring* instructions.

For instance, I had a student in one of my last classes who brought a toy truck into the classroom, and was playing with it instead of listening, moving all around the room. I politely told him to return to his seat, he pretended he couldn't hear me. I offered him a choice to return to his seat on his own, or to give me the truck, he just straight told me ""no"". Now I'm not going to get into a wrestling match with a 6 year old to take a toy away, and I could tell that if I went that route that's what would happen. I could call the office or for an EA, but he didn't have an IEP. From past experience in other rooms with kids that had much higher behaviour issues, it was almost a guaranteed that the support staff already had their hands full and couldn't come help with this. Heck, I was only there the afternoon, and one of the kids in that class was already spending the whole time in the office due to violent outbursts that morning. I've also had kids who would run out of the room unless you physically stood in the way over things as small as asking them to write their name on their page. Also just being loud and not caring at all about making a ruckus when other students are trying to work. And it all compounds, since then the other students start saying things like ""if she doesn't have to work, why do I?"" and so on.

I've talked to the VP there about general advice for the kids there, and her response was basically ""if I think of something, I'll let you know"". 

What do you do in these situations? I have tried providing incentives (e.g. getting some ""free time"" if they behave), but these kids in particular seem to take the stance that the default is not getting that, and often they just say they'd rather get to do whatever bad behaviour than to get a reward. Like they see it as Good behaviour -&gt; Reward, and they reverse it so that by giving up the reward, it gives them permission to misbehave. And then they're used to being punished, so even a note home is nothing to them, and some of them already get daily notes home even on good days just to balance out how often they are sent home with bad notes.

Sorry if this is all rambling. I tried to be really specific, because all the online resources are both longterm strategies that I can't really implement in a single afternoon, or even full day, or are for such minor issues that they assume simply addressing the student is enough to get them to stop, and I'd like help for this specific issue. I'm at my wit's end with this, and even hearing ""that's just how it is with some schools"" would be helpful, because as it is, I feel like I'm failing at my job when this is a constant issue at this school.",,84169j,,0,,false,1522296270,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,"",false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/84169j/help_with_classroom_management_for_a_sub/,,"",,,

After graduation I plan to (hopefully) get a teaching job at one of the many charter schools here in New York City. My rationale is simple: I really do not want to spend time trying to get DOE certification *yet*. I am aware of some of the downsides, among which include worse hours, less pay, nightmare administrations, and so on. However, I have heard there are some great charter schools here that teachers love. 

So.. how hard is it to become a charter school teacher in NYC? When do I even begin to apply / when are they scouting for staff? I don't have any real teaching experience, outside of leading seminar presentations in graduate school. I have heard about a teacher shortage and that it won't be too hard to find a job, but I have also heard reports that conflict with this. I have heard that there is a specific teacher shortage for men, and I am (weirdly) hoping to capitalize on that? 

Are there any pointers or advice you can give? How realistic is it for someone with an MA in philosophy to get a charter school teaching job? I feel competent enough to handle courses on humanities, european civ, philosophy, history, politics, feminism and gender studies. Are there classes like these in NYC charter schools? I also really wouldn't mind teaching reading or english which I imagine is in much more demand.

Thank you so much for your help and time.

I graduated in May of this year with my Bachelor's and teaching license, so I have been interviewing all summer for my first real teaching job. I live in New Jersey, but am using fake names for the districts.

I interviewed for a job in the ""Balboa"" school district and was called back to do a demo lesson on Wednesday, August 2nd. This would be for a full year long term sub position. On Wednesday afternoon, ""Maycomb"" district called me and I asked if I wanted to come in for an interview on Monday, August 8th. This would be for an actual position with the potential to return again next year. 

On Thursday August 3rd, Balboa tells me that they have selected me as the candidate to be recommended for the long term sub job. I asked them if I could have until Tuesday August 8th to give them my definitive yes or no answer. 

So this is the dilemma in my mind. I want to interview for that position in Maycomb because it isn't a sub job, it has the potential for long term work. I am going to go to the interview Monday and I am going to ask them what they believe their timeline will be for hiring someone for this position. I know this is a one in the hand is worth two in the bush situation. Ultimately, I don't know if Maycomb will offer me a job and I'd be happy to work in Balboa, I'm just wondering if there is a way for me to explore all of my options.

**If the following scenario occurred where I say ""Yes, I'll accept your position"" to the Balboa school, then find out Maycomb has offered a job to me as well. Would I be allowed to back out of the Balboa situation? If Maycomb doesn't get back to me for a week and I sign a contract with Balboa, is that that? It's done? Or what else should I do?**

Info about the districts. They're both great academically, have great reviews about their elementary schools (where I would be working.) Balboa is 30 minutes away from my home (I live with my parents) so I wouldn't have to move. Maycomb is about 50-60 minutes away and it may require me to move closer to the district.

Qup is a new, free, online Q&amp;A community built for AP students and teachers. We chose the word community carefully. While it contains all the bells and whistles of a modern Q&amp;A site (go ahead, add LaTeX to your posts!) Qup will live or die by the way its users interact. As it launches for this school year, we are carefully crafting the site to be a place where students are empowered to ask for help regarding course concepts. Peers and teachers from around the United States then provide detailed answers tailored to that student's current level of understanding.
We need your help to create a community with the right tone. Verified teachers are our moderators. You have the ability to edit questions and responses (history is saved and visible!) or delete content if it is inappropriate. At launch, we have only enabled Math and Computer Science AP courses as that is what our founders and friends teach, but we can quickly and easily add other courses if there is interest.

I hope you will consider clicking the link below and evaluating whether or not to sign up and/or encourage your students to do the same. Even if you just want to share feedback, I would appreciate that too. PM me or use the site's contact form if you'd like to get your verified teacher badge and privileges.

Quora and Yahoo Answers are not the communities that students need. Help us make Qup a place where teachers can really connect with students outside the classroom. Thanks :)

First off, just wanted to make it clear that I'm using a throwaway account just to err on the side of caution. 

I attended high school from 2004-2008, and I originally wanted to be a teacher but right around the time I was getting into my more advanced college classes, a lot of controversial stuff in the teaching world was happening that freaked me out, and I backed out of it and changed my major. I also graduated young, and didn't want to be in a classroom setting with people barely younger than myself (I wanted, and still do, to teach secondary education). I'm in a position in life where I am considering going back to school to get the alternative teaching certification and possibly a Master's Degree (which is a different matter entirely). 

I know that it is largely based on region/subject matter, but generally speaking just how much has changed in a public high school (or even middle school) setting in the last 10-15 years or so? Mostly with technology, teaching standards/common core, etc. I feel so out of touch with what high school has to be like now that I wouldn't fully know where to even start. 

I'd be teaching English (that's what my Bachelor's is in). When I was in high school, English (or at least what I recall) mostly consisted of vocabulary, etymology, some writing, reading, book reports, and we also acted out a few plays and recited some quotes. I only took regular English... I actually rather hated English in high school so I never took honors or AP classes. I also didn't have an English teacher younger than the age of 50 until my senior year, but that fact makes me feel like I'm even more out of touch. 

I'm still deciding whether or not this is actually something I want to do, but if it is... what does the average classroom experience even look like nowadays? What has changed since 2004, with the advent of smartphones and common core? Is it even a good idea to go into this field right now when I'm 26?

Some back story: I'm certified to teach k-6 but I've been down on my luck with money since I graduated in May and couldn't apply for my license until a month ago or pay for my licensing tests. In my state you can get your teaching license without your tests as long as you attempt to take the tests in the first year of teaching and pass in your second year. My school gave each teaching graduate a letter serving as a placeholder for our licenses since they know it takes about 6 weeks for the department of public instruction to process applications. Nevertheless, the districts I've applied to are very picky about the documentation required to be considered for a teaching position. They want my license, my test scores, and a form of disclosure. I can only technically give them the disclosure form but all I have in place for my license is that letter from the school and I haven't been able to take my test yet because financially I've barely gotten by this summer.

Along with 100 other things.... so yea I missed it. I missed a lot, this shit is so unorganized it's ridiculous, I've never heard of a organization/position this poorly managed and unprepared.

So yea, overall I'm not doing a great job but I didn't think I was doing horribly. I still have issues but I thought I was doing somewhat ok. Mainly because I had been asking for help for weeks and never really got it, or rather... I didn't get the help I was asking for. It's like eating soup, asking for a spoon, and they hand you a dog treat. 

This week admin came on on Monday to observe and had major issues. In another post I said that they had a huge problem with me ending the class without answering a question. My thought was that it would be good for them to have things go unanswered sometimes (I put more in my other post) but anyway. She's pissed off because we've been in school for 2 months and I'm still not completely prepared everyday... which I thought I was mostly prepared but apparently I'm not.

Tuesday and Wednesday I got sick, really sick, and then was able to stick it out today although I still felt like shit, I knew it would normally look good if I pushed through. Maybe some brownie points or something.... but no.

Today my Vp came in, saw half the lesson and then at one point took over the class when I was between things and tried to make them work independently. Now, this class has been my hardest class to get control of and make pay attention. When I cover material they constantly say ""you didn't teach us that"" when I had just went over it yesterday, but my other classes get it just fine. 

My VP is a math teacher and she's good at it. So now this class who already doesn't respect me at all and I've been having issues with is just going to respect me less. Unless she's planning on firing me idk what to do.

Overall idk what to do or what to think right now. I'm upset that she did it and upset that she felt like she had to do it.  

I'm normally someone who can do just about anything somewhat well and thought that I would be ""not horrible"" after a few months of teaching. I thought I was getting better and now I'm questioning everything, which only adds to the stress that goes along with everything else involved in teaching in general.

So I'm curious, is that a normal thing for a VP/head teacher to do? Does this mean I should really start looking? 

It's also the VPs first year (maybe second) as VP, and last year the person in my position only lasted about a month I think.

But I can't deal with the kids that make it their mission to make my life miserable. I absolutely can't deal with the 70+ hour weeks (I know this is suppose to become less over time, but I am taking a quick break from grading... making this a 12 hour day). I can't deal with grading horrible papers or the apathy.

I know I want to be a really good teacher, but I also know I want out... and soon.

Does anyone else feel like this? Or left the classroom to do something else? Are you glad you did?

The teacher across the hall basically made the sign of the cross and wished me luck; she handed me a Nat Geo for Kids and a packet. She said my block for the day was to hand out the magazine, ask everyone to read silently, then pass out the packets and have them finished quietly until the bell. The packet was not going to be graded; it was just busy work.

I thought that sounded miserable, so I immediately made the decision to ditch the packet altogether and mix up the lesson. Our lesson was about sharks and I looove science and nature, so ad-libbing wouldn't be a problem. Instead of silent reading, we had a class discussion and made the classroom an open forum-type sharing of questions and facts about sharks. It was a blast! We talked about shark gills, shark skin, how their teeth grow in, Megalodon....

This was what made this particular lesson really special for me: Later in the day during my prep/lunch period, I had four children from various classes walk into the room from their library/study class. They each brought me a shark-themed project they decided to do on their own just because the lesson was fun for them! I got a picture with labels, a list of shark facts, a scale photo of Megalodon and a VW Bug, and a basic shark anatomy picture. 

It was a really special moment, and I'm so happy I made that day better for those kids.

I know there are a ton of other great stories out there, so let's hear them!

TL;DR I had a great time teaching about sharks and the students did work on their own time for me! Let's hear some other cool teaching moments!",,7x51um,,0,,false,1520526260,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7x51um/most_rewardingsatisfying_teaching_moments/,,,,,

I know it comes with the territory of teaching alternative, but I am having a difficult time dealing with the students. I really enjoy them one-on-one or in a small environment, but if the class exceeds five students it gets hard to handle. 

It is really like something out of a movie. These kids have rough lives and I have a lot of empathy for them. However, it is difficult to make it through the day when work is not getting done along with hearing stuff I really do not need to hear.

I keep telling myself its going to be okay, eventually they will take school seriously. But it is February, and there has been little to no improvement. I can feel the burnout coming.

However, I've been noticing a general lack of respect and the students being off task and walking around even WHEN they have everything they need to work on. I've been bad about warnings with little follow through, and I spent literally all class period running around putting out little fires... while being observed. It's not just one or two students any more, I've let it go too long and the attitude is seeping into every one of them. The issue is we literally have a week left of the nine weeks and I'm struggling with dealing with the mess I have created but still being an effective teacher for what little time I still have these kids until the next 9 week batch comes in. I talked with some administration at the school about some potential tactics I can use and I was thinking of using the sticky note technique where I mark a strike on it, and three strikes, you're out. Administration even said that if I need to send a three-striker out to make a point, that'd be ok considering my difficulty. However, I'm looking for options for whole-class. The countdown (5, 4, 3.. etc) is one technique I may try to get everyone settled, but I admit I'm worried I've lost this class to the point that won't work. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for me, or is this just going to be about putting out my little fires right off the bat in the class to nip it in the bud and just streamline my teaching and flow from one activity to the other?

I got recently hired to teach ""French or English to groups of people of various ages"". I'm a student, that was the only job I managed to get because I have experience as a volunteer tutor at college and on r/French. I started last week, it's two hours per week, and I'm now understanding that I have to teach French to my bosses' kids, who are Chinese. The kids are 4, 6, and 8 years old.

I have absolutely no experience with kids :( I do have a job as an archery coach, but I rarely work with kids that are that young, and I never had to teach a foreign language to kids. I also never had experience with teaching a foreign language to kids or, well, simply people who DON'T want to learn French. These three kids have to learn French because they are obliged by the law (I live in Québec) to go to a French school. The youngest is the best and does sound willing to learn French, unlike the oldest one who keeps asking why he has to learn it and doesn't see the point to it because ""he will have no one to talk to in French"".

1) How do I motivate the 6/8 y.o. ones to learn a language they don't want to learn?
2) How do I teach a language to these 3 kids? The two youngest girls don't know how to read and the older one likes to boss them around and likes to hijack my lessons by trying to teach them how to read in English, and if I do activities that aren't at his level, he loudly whines that he's soooooo bored.

It got me thinking -- what advice would you give your first year teacher self? I came up with the following:

1) The way to be successful your first year of teaching is to surround yourself with positive people -- in your personal life, and in your professional life. The people you went through your training program with have the potential to be both. They understand the unique experience that you are going through – the challenges and the victories. Lean on them, learn from them. But do not go to Target with them. You will talk each other into buying things you don’t need with money you don’t have.

2) In your new school, you will meet dedicated, transformative educators and leaders. You will also meet new co-workers who exemplify the kind of teacher that you do not want to be. Treat both groups of people with respect and kindness, but dedicate your time to learning from those that are actively working towards improving their school communities.

3) “Solutions-Oriented” sounds like a LinkedIn buzzword. It’s not. 95% of what school leaders hear from staff, faculty, parents, and students are problems. Your principal will be a lot more receptive to helping you figure out your problems if you come to them with some solutions in mind.

4) PACK A LUNCH. The delivery guy does NOT understand that you only have 20 minutes for lunch and that being 10 minutes late with food means that you don’t eat until dismissal. Then you are eating a cold meatball sub at the staff meeting while everyone around you has perfectly proportioned snack sets with carrots, hummus, and roasted almonds. Meanwhile, you’re stinking up the room with your cold meatball sub like some kind of chump. Pack a lunch.",,6s2cv8,,0,,false,1504652251,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/6s2cv8/what_advice_would_you_give_to_your_yearone/,,,,,

I have been teaching French Immersion for about 3 years, taking on, on average, 2 long-term subbing contracts lasting me the whole school year.  This year, I have a contract until January in first grade.

Therefore, I'm looking for advice on how and when to introduce the class routines and procedures.

I'm currently a sophomore at Saint Joseph's University and I'm studying elementary education (pk-4 cert). 

I was wondering if anyone would be willing to share with me their Montessori curriculum guides for a couple of subjects as unfortunately it seems as if I'm the first one in any of my professors classes (either last year or currently) that would like to pursue a career in Montessori education. This limits my access to any of the AMA or AMI curricula as I personally being a broke college student don't have a couple thousand dollars to shell out for a 6-12 guide and my university does not have any resources available for my use nor are they willing to purchase any. 

The reason i'm asking for these guides is I have a term paper that requires analysis of an educational philosophy of our choice and mine is of course Montessori! I would love to be able to view a full set of 6-12 curricula and be able to reference it in my paper and I truly believe it will most definitely assist me in getting the attention of my professors turned towards the possibility of a Montessori mindset. 

Thank you again and if you are aware of any resources please do let me know as all I have found are either short tidbits or plans that are extremely inadequate and poorly written.

I'm wondering how best to deal with the situation.  They very well could have not heard me at all because the halls echo and it's hard to understand dialogue, but they very well could have heard me because of their proximity.  I've already learned my lesson, and I will never talk about a student out in the open again.

Did it the other day and admin had a fit.,"I teach HS math, pre-algebra (kids who failed previous math), and we were working a problem. I taught a lot of this stuff already, 3-4 times, but I was reworking a problem on the board. I'm also a new teacher with no education experience.

At the end of the class we had a problem where the kids weren't sure how to answer the question. I tried to help them think it through and figure out the issue using the long way to do things. It was close to the end of class but a few of the kids were actually interested, which never happens. So I let them debate and tried to make them think, well we didn't get to figure out the answer before the end of class so I didn't tell them the answer.

 Before the year started I watched a lot of TED talks and did a lot of research about what teachers are aiming for in the future. I'm definitely a ""non-traditional"" style teacher and focus on making the kids think for themselves.

This is why I thought doing this was ok. Not only had I walked them through this style of problem multiple times, but some of them were interested and thinking. Although they did get frustrated, that was kind of the point. A teacher won't always be there to help. 

I'm wondering if this is as big of a deal as administration is making it? Or am I right in the way I was doing it?  Is there a better way to do it maybe?

I personally think I was right to do this, if I'm not I really need to know and I need to know why.

However, I'm after general ""how to"" advice. I'm going to University online, the lecturer takes a few days to get back to me and I'm hoping to wrap this assignment up ASAP. I could use the discussion board, but then I'm asking fellow students and it generally just ends up answering questions, with another question or a ""well this is what Im doing"" - so we can both be wrong together haha

I'm currently doing an assignment for English, year 6. We have to put together a 3 lesson plans where we have to include, amongst other things... 

* explicitly teach appropriate text features (structure, language and multimodal) for reading, comprehension, and writing
* use specific strategies to differentiate learning for English is an additional language or dialect EAL/D children 

I'm stuck on *how* to include specific EAL/D learning activities, that work alongside the classroom activities. I'm also not sure if I'm specifically addressing text features.

I've looked online, but I don't know if I'm looking for the wrong thing or just not understanding how to turn the information I find into activities for EAL/D students. The *two* textbooks we've got for the subject, have 1 page each on EAL/D students and they pretty much give a definition of what EAL/D means and say ""yep, they happen and you have to include them in the lessons as well.""


Lesson 1: Watch a documentary. Discuss language used: keywords, tense, what did they learn. Split the class into groups, give them a transcript and have them read it outloud. Discuss the differences between the voiceover, scene descriptions and interviewees. In their English workbooks, write a script for a news broadcaster who would describe what is happening throughout the documentary. 

*EAL/D student would be grouped with students who are able to help, when necessary* - Which is basically passing the buck to the students. 

Lesson 2: Although I haven't written it down. They would re-create the documentary in different ways EG: Cartoon, tweet, poster. Focusing on grammar / language (text features) change the 'validity' of the message

Lesson 3: Trying to bring it all together. Go to the library, research valid information via books/internet (multimodal), and create a report on small report on &lt;topic&gt;, that will then be shown to the group. They'd have to do a speech and poster(s) or Powerpoint presentation. 

I'm after some specific activities that I could use in order to teach EAL/D students, and some confirmation/corrections on whether or not I'm 'specifically' targeting the text features 'structure, language and multimodal' for reading, comprehension, and writing.

Therefore I want to share something I have been working on for a couple of semesters. I often come here to find new ideas I can use in my classroom and thought this might help other STEM teachers out there in some way. I also would love some feedback. I loved this project but grading it was difficult so I would love ideas on how I could pull it together in a way that would make it easier to grade. If you look at the student work samples, I wanted to keep it open so I didn't limit my students creativity but because of that we struggled with how to truly grade this since so many items were in so many different places. 

Background: 
So early last year I was asked by my media specialist if I would be interested in collaborating on a project with her and another STEM teacher. I agreed because I have seen that my students are lacking in the literacy skills that they really need in order to truly succeed in my classroom. 

Our team consisted of myself (a chemistry teacher), our media specialist, and an oceanography teacher. Together we attended a training  with School Librarians Advancing STEM Learning SLASL (who is supported by Institute for the Study of
KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN EDUCATION (ISKME) http://www.iskme.org/) on how to create a project that we would collaborate on, write up, do, and then publish on as an open educational resource on OERcommons.org. 

This experience was great because as a teacher I learned how to evaluate and determine new types of open education resources that I can remix and use correctly in my classroom without this fear that I was breaking major copyright rules. This project also really helped me see how awesome it can be to collaborate with teachers outside of chemistry and how that can bring a new richness to my own content for my students. 

So with all that in mind, feel free to check out our unit plan (link at the bottom). The plan is written so that you can be a chemistry teacher or an oceanography teacher (or biology maybe too) and incorporate this project over the course of a unit on either the ocean or a unit about acids and bases. Check it out, you might find you want to do the whole unit or there might just be a small piece you like and can use. Either way, it is an open education resource so you are welcome to use it however you would like as long as you give us credit. You can even make changes and alter it as needed to fit the needs of your students. 

I love that this project has really opened my eyes to how I can use reading/literacy in my science classroom to teach my content but also help my students improve those skills that will be so necessary in their future! 

Feel free to give us feedback below, we are still working on making improvements and there are a few things we know we need to tweak before we do this again. 

Thanks for reading and for your feedback and I hope this helps some teacher out there!

It started as me thinking that I better try growing it out while I can, before I graduate and need to get a more professional haircut to get a job.  However, in doing so I've found that I kind of enjoy it.  I foresee this one posing more of an issue than the beard, but I would love to hear from anyone who may have personal experience, suggestions, etc.

I'm finding the workload is intense to say the least. My classes are 20-28 students per class, I have 24 contact hours a week (4 different classes 6 periods a week), plus a minimum of 3 hours of meetings and 2-3 hours a week of extended essay support. I have ~100 students split across the 4 classes and 2 preps if I don't differentiate, more if I do. If we're talking a 40 hour work week (lol) that leaves me with ~10 hours a week for prep and grading, and that's completely neglecting extra-curriculars.

Is this common for the IB diploma programme? I came into it with the expectation that typically the class sizes were considerably smaller. I have great support from more experienced teachers, but I still often feel overwhelmed. I don't intend to leave, but I really need to find a way to cope with the increased workload. I find myself skipping lunch and taking work home frequently. Today was especially difficult because my lessons didn't go well. Time I had planned to use for planning out the specifics of a lesson was taken up by a meeting.

This is my second year full time, on top of three previous years of subbing full time and one year of overseas teaching

Obviously the biggest one would be ""Pay them more"", but these are other things that I think would help

1. Stop guilting teachers
I've seen admin, teachers, parents, random people all do this: a teacher might contemplate quitting on social media, or complain about work conditions, stress, whatever. And they're usually met with ""But think of the kids!!!"" or ""Lol but you guys have three months off!"". Yes, the students are important, and yes, teachers get a decent amount of vacation time, but those shouldn't be reasons for ignoring the issues going in our schools. The biggest example I can think of is from a couple of weeks ago, last year's Oklahoma teacher of the year moved to Texas for better pay and work conditions, and this year's Oklahoma teacher of the year basically said ""He obviously doesn't care about the kids!!!"". We need to stop shaming teachers for wanting better than what they have

2. Don't glorify the stress they go through
Teaching is the epitome of America's toxic obsession with work, as in, the idea that the more hours you work, the better a worker you must be. I see teachers basically bragging about the amount of time they work now, one person might say they work 65 hours a week and another might say they're working 75. The martyring of teachers is something that absolutely needs to end. We need to stop saying ""Wow, you work so hard and so long for those kids, you're a hero!"". Yes, God bless teachers who are going above and beyond despite the garbage pay and unrealistic expectations, but I'm sure most of those teachers would trade being a ""hero"" for better pay and a better work environment. Not to mention that, unless a teacher somehow got hired at gunpoint, they generally know what they're getting into nowadays if they're younger/newer. That doesn't justify how stressful a lot of schools are, but it's not like these people were signed up blindly either. Related to this, teachers themselves need to stop being self-congratulatory. Hell, wearing a shirt that says ""I teach, what's your superpower?"" is just cringey. There is nothing particularly unique about being a teacher, unless you count ""getting shit on a lot"" as being a unique part of the job. They might as well wear something that says ""I work long hours for terrible money but refuse to do much about it, what's your superpower?"". I've met a lot of good teachers, but I've never seen such a job with so many people patting themselves on the back as often (maybe programmers and nurses too?)

3. Make education degrees tougher to get
Again, I've met a lot of good people who are teachers, and I respect a lot of what they do, especially given the conditions. But let's not fool ourselves, teachers are dime a dozen, and most teachers aren't particularly intelligent, creative, etc. Nice people, yes, but nothing special. Think of it this way: if we required teachers to get degrees in whatever subject they wanted to teach, we'd lose most of our teachers. I think it's telling that a lot of teachers I've met give the impression that if they didn't teach, they'd probably just be a stay at home moms, or work retail somewhere. I've never met a teacher and thought, ""Damn, that person would make a great engineer"". Which leads me to my next point

4. We need diversity
When I was going through college the education department was basic white girl headquarters, with a chunk of those being girls who a) thought nursing was too hard, or b) couldn't figure out anything else to do with their lives. This didn't change when I was subbing, as again, at least 95% of the teachers I met were white. We need more women of color, and we need more men (of any kind) in our schools, especially elementary school. The abundance of average white women in our schools might actually be hurting us as we enter 2018 and have more diverse students than ever. Though maybe if we paid better we'd get more kinds of people applying... (Related: the whole ""white woman savior"" complex really needs to end. Nothing makes me cringe more than the white girl who decides to try and teach in the ghetto because she wants to ""rescue"" the kids)

5. Feminism
Before people start get up in arms about this, hear me out. For a field that's so heavily dominated by women, a lot of the teachers I've met either vote Republican or are strangely apathetic to social/political issues as a whole (unless, of course, it concerns their job/pay directly). One thing we could be doing is hiring more socially aware teachers (NOT social justice warriors/Tumblr feminists). After all, for a lot of kids, who better to empower them than their teachers, since they're not getting it at home? But that doesn't happen, because oftentimes the teachers themselves don't seem to care/know anything

I always come up with my own activities in case teachers didn't have time to leave their own and in general I find that I do pretty good at keeping my students calm and to make them do their work. Of course I've had more trouble with a class or two but in general- no bad comments, sometimes positive criticism- and I've been called back many times. 

Last week I was asked to substitute for a teacher in this very small school (60 students) in 3rd grade where there are 8 kids. Sounds like the ideal class to substitute... I said sure and prepared various activities and whatnot. 

According to me, we had a great day. I got asked that very same day to come back the next day- which I did. Then, the next day when I got there, the secretary told me that I'd have to make an extra effort today because the previous day had gone really bad, that teachers were complaining about too much noise and that children got hurt. I was baffled. I asked the secretary which kids got hurt and if she was sure we were talking about the same class. She said yes and that parents had written notes... Ok.... She said she'd have someone come and help me till I can prove that I can take care of the class. 

Honestly, I just wanted to leave. After I got the students from outside and they were all sitting quietly reading I asked them if they knew about anyone getting hurt yesterday in my class. They said yes, but at recess. I told them that they should have let me know, but ultimately it was the lunch and recess monitors that should have. We had another super great quiet day and during lunch time a few teachers asked for my name and phone number to substitute when they'd be gone. 

I said bye to the secretary and left. Then, this morning, I get a call from the school board telling them that on BOTH days I was there that I did a very bad substituting job. The HR at the school board knows me and asked me what happened to which I quickly summarized what had happened. She said we should arrange a meeting with the school, the school board and myself to talk it out, otherwise it can be dragged onto my file. The school said that *students* were complaining that the class was too noisy and disorganized... It's completely impossible in my mind. I have a copy of all the work we've done and I have a copy of the substituting report I handed in to the teacher... We also had that '3 color light noise detector' and it NEVER went off. Meaning, the classroom never got too noisy.

When I first started teaching I quickly realized how inadequate my undergraduate and graduate teaching programs were. This is not to say I didn’t find anything of value there, but I didn’t effectively learn how to do basic things like creating an objective for my lessons. Instead, I was taught a very Marxist approach to learning where all students need to do is have discussions about oppression and that will lead them to success. I floundered in a sea of educational chaos, during my first-year teaching, needless to say. Though, at the time I felt I was the benevolent rebel fighting against the oppressive charter school I worked for. Yet, my second year I completely flipped the script combining some of my ideas on existentialism, democracy and the charter school I worked at’s philosophy of structure and direction. One of the most important things I learned was how to create an objective. A rigorous and specific objective is the anchor that holds down the lesson. Everything you do as a teacher should keep in mind, what is it you want your students to be able to do on their own by the end of your time with them. Each day this comes in the form of the learning objective. 

Main Points

Determine outcome 

Could be based on state standards, common core etc.

Trust yourself to know what students should learn (you’ll most likely be able to align this to a standard) 
o	What will an exemplar look like? What qualities will it have? Create a rubric or criteria for success
2)	Determine an action using Blooms Taxonomy or similar 
o	http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/bloom.html (Use list for key words)
o	Most admins will want to see you above the understanding piece. Though I think when making coherent units, it’s often necessary to make the objectives in early lessons that of remembering or understanding, but you can always manipulate the way to objective is written to appease administrators. Example: If you want students to understand a concept like Imperialism by describing it, since that is a tough concept for some students and 45 minutes might only be enough time to just be able to describe it, you can say “students will be able to “demonstrate” their understanding of imperialism using an example from history” Technically that wouldn’t be in the “understand category it would be under the applying category.

Passive Verbs to Avoid
appreciate	enjoy	learn	realize
believe	know	like	understand

Active Verbs to Use			
add	compute	inspect	rate
alphabetize	construct	list	review
assemble	debate	locate	say
assess	define	match	select
build	design	measure	show
calculate	discuss	operate	solve
collect	draw	place	speak
color	explain	plan	write
compare			


3)	Be specific
o	Simply saying something like students will “create an algebraic equation” or they will “solve for x in an expression” is not specific enough. I usually make sure I do the following in every objective I write:
	Active verb (use blooms)
	How many
	How to accomplish? By Using… (whatever the scaffold or strategy you taught)
	Checklist for evaluation (Criteria for success, future episode): What show’s mastery? Accuracy? Quality? Quantity? Etc.
o	SWBAT solve two algebraic equations by using cross multiplication to isolate the variable 

Recap once:
1) Determine outcome 
2) Determine action Using Blooms
3) Be Specific

Example
1)	Determine Outcome: Using the cc standard: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.9-10.1
Cite strong and thorough textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the text.
o	Using the story “The Lottery” by Shirley Jackson which is “spoiler alert” about a town that has a lottery every year, you think it’s a positive lottery but it turns out the winner of the lottery gets stoned to death.
In the text determine for yourself what an exemplar inference looks like: 
“Soon the men began to gather, surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call their children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times.”

This section of text from ""The Lottery"" indicates a few possibilities. One is that the people gathering for the lottery, the stoning, are so used to this tradition that it is treated with the same nonchalance that they treat other routines. This is why they engage in small talk about planting, taxes, and tractors.

2)	SWBAT Using Blooms and be 3) specific: Inferences fall under analysis, but I can even go higher in my phrasing so I will say:
o	SWBAT create two inferences about the town depicted in “The Lottery” by using accurate text evidence and reasoning
o	Criteria for Success: Next Time?

Recap
1) Determine outcome 
2) SWBAT Using Blooms
3) Be Specific
Questions that remain for future episodes
1) How to create a Criteria for success?
2) What if my admin wants something different? 
3) What if students don’t master?
4) How to differentiate objectives?
5) Language objectives?

Conclusion

Without the lesson objective, a classroom will most likely feel aimless. That doesn’t necessarily mean no learning will take place, but you can be so much more efficient and focused if you have a clear objective on what you want students to leave with knowing or being able to do.

I’m a junior in high school with a whopping 1.3 GPA and 3 months of night school and I’m pretty close to being fucked. 

This is not me deflecting the blame for my poor performance in school. I might’ve had a million personal problems but that’s not an excuse for a GPA that low. However , I was dealt a horrible hand with teachers in an area notorious for it’s horrible teaching - Had I actually had good teacher since early on it might’ve been different. Just wanna give a quick few pointers to dealing with those pesky shitty students.

1) If a kid is constantly putting his head down , Isn’t social , seems withdrawn and generally isn’t very aware in your class then chances are he’s either depressed or going through a rough time. Screaming at him or scorning him infront of your class makes you no different than any schoolyard douchebag bullying him - Actually It’s worse because you’re in a position of power.

2) Chances are you and other teachers of your subject are teaching the same exact state approved material. The only difference comes in the structure of what you’re teaching. Good structure is everything. If you constantly overwork your students and give too much busywork then expect to find them falling asleep and withdrawn from your class. 
This isn’t them personally trying to disrespect you or making you look dumb. It’s the byproduct of having 7 other classes and that are just as rigorous as yours.
Remember high school is the first time you’re confronted with actual big boy stress and a lot of students who haven’t experienced this before are pretty much screwed.

3) Vocabulary alone doesn’t help students remember anything. Writing down a word and It’s definition alone doesn’t help anything stick out in my mind. Vocabulary in context leads to actually understanding the meaning. No writing involved. 

4) Have empathy. A lot of teachers were ace students and since early on they pretty much figured everything out early on , So they expect everybody else to be the same. 
If a student is a dick and performing poorly then by all means fail them and don’t look back , However if you find a student genuinely struggling and being respectful. Give him the benefit of the doubt.


That’s pretty much everything. I’ve been browsing through here and seeing some of your common complaints with students. I don’t want to overstep my boundaries in telling you exactly what to do. In all honesty I don’t know much about teaching but if teachers offered me these four courtesies earlier on I would’ve been the great student I used to be.

There’s a tangible rift between students and teachers do to you on average being 15-30 years older than most of us. We’re so different culturally and in our values that a lot of time intent is lost.

I've never been one for all the colorful and cute decorations that your average teacher pollutes their room with, or litters all over their worksheets and projects. School, to me, has always been about learning, first and foremost, and having cute nonsense on homework and in your classroom doesn't do anything for a student's grades

That's not to say I'm anti-fun. There's a reason I've been the most popular teacher at both schools I've taught at, and it's because I have a relatable personality and I'm in tune with the kids like. For example, one time for Fun Friday one of my boys brought his Nintendo Switch in, and we took turns playing Rocket League. There have also been plenty of times where my kids and I take a brain break by watching a funny video, looking at (school appropriate) memes, or just talking about things like movies, games, etc. To boot, I treat my kids like human beings and never talk down to them. I've let them participate in making decisions about our class numerous times (How should we arrange our desks? What did you guys think of that project we just did, if we do something similar again what should we change? Things like that). This is how you get kids to respect and enjoy you, not by having stereotypical Pinterest trash 

One of my student's parents made sure to bring this up during student conferences in the fall, saying that they ""loved"" how I didn't ""waste my time on silliness"". The mother is from Belarus, and she told me that she finds a lot of the stuff elementary teachers do here as menial and making little difference to the kids' education (""I'm really glad you don't sing any songs"" is one of the things she told me). They share similar beliefs to me: school is about learning, but you can relax and enjoy yourself after you've worked hard

Don't get me wrong, you can do all the cute stuff and be a good teacher, but a lot of people seem to miss the fact that it's absolutely non-essential to teaching. And before you ask, no, I don't have a bare, boring room. I do have educational posters up. I've got drawings from the kids around the room. That's about it. In terms of our work I use whatever comes with the textbook, and if I make something myself it's pretty bare bones

Anyone else like this?",,7wwhqw,,0,,false,1520520824,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7wwhqw/any_other_elementary_teachers_not_into_the/,,,,,

Throughout my years of subbing and then when I did my teaching degree and started working full time, I met many teachers, most of who were genuine, nice people. But one thing I always noticed was just about all these teachers didn't seem to have any hobbies outside of work. Sure, they might have enjoyed reading the occasional book, going to the gym, etc, but those aren't really hobbies or passions

And the longer I've taught, the clearer the answer became: the public school system doesn't give you the time to have hobbies outside of teaching, especially if you have a family (and/or you need to find a second job to help pay your bills). I can't speak for middle or high school teachers (I imagine they're similar though), but speaking from an elementary POV, there's lesson planning, all the grading, the quizzes and tests, the countless meetings, the PD. I'm sure a lot of teachers would love to take up some kind of hobby or leisurely activity, but chances are they get home and either a) are too tired to do anything beyond watch TV and relax or b) they see their options as being either doing an activity but getting behind on work or just working more and leaving the activity behind

It's really, truly a shame. As wonderful as our teachers are one can only wonder how much better they could be if they were allowed the time to pursue their own interests away from work; a lot of people, including teachers, seem to forget or ignore their own mental well-being

Unfortunately I don't see this changing anytime soon. Public education doesn't seem able/willing to make the necessary changes and sacrifices to improve itself. Which means that teachers will continue to be drained, and more will continue to leave the field (I don't know about other states, but I heard last week that Illinois, my state, has ~2,000 teaching positions still open)",,7xe1y0,,0,,false,1520532309,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7xe1y0/ive_always_wondered_why_teachers_dont_have/,,,,,

I've had a number of professors and teachers tell me that I need to be up front about what extracurricular activities I would be willing to sponsor or coach. One even said that I won't get any good job offers unless I am willing to sponsor or coach. 

This is concerning to me as two friends and I started a small business last semester. Something I was looking forward to about teaching is being able to leave before 4pm and pursue other interests. 

My schedule for student teaching has gone like this: 

- Get there at 6:45. Make copies, prep for lessons, catch up on emails/meetings/whatever

- Teach from 7:50 - 3:00. 

- Plan, meetings, etc until 4:00 at the latest. 

- Use the rest of my afternoon and evening how I want. Sometimes I grade at 9pm watching a TV show. Sometimes I grade Saturday morning. Sometimes I get my planning and grading done during my planning period. 

I told my cooperating teacher that I didn't want to coach or sponsor any clubs and talked to her about our small business. Her exact words were, ""Oh honey, your ass belongs to the school until you get tenured."" 

Starting salary = $36k/year in my state. I knew ahead of time that you don't get into teaching for the money, but I figured if I did my job well, I could spend the extra afternoon hours pursuing other interests if I wanted. 

Sorry if I'm coming off as angry, but I don't think it's fair that this is the next three years of my life. I can teach English and supposedly I'm good at it. I don't know anything about sports! Or debate team! 

And why should I have to work so many extra hours for so little pay? They said being a volleyball coach pays $800 a YEAR. 

Is this the reality of being a new teacher?

I'm extremely excited to say that I have my first teaching placement in a couple of months! It is with a joint Year 1-2 class (5-6 years of age) in a very small school. 

Although I've been looking forward to this moment since enrolling in the degree, I'm now hit with the realisation that I will be looked at and assessed as a teacher-in-training, and for the first time will be told whether or not it appears as though I ""have what it takes"". 

So, what advice can you offer? How can I make a good impression to my mentor right off the bat? What general advice do you have for being in a classroom for the first time? What specific advice do you have for children in that age group?

I've volunteered at a primary school in the past where I helped run a science club for Year 5 students, including running some of my own lessons, but it was outside of school hours and so it wasn't a true classroom experience and typically only featured students that were already doing well academically. 

My uni only expects me to observe for the 2 weeks, though they do say that the mentor teacher is welcome to ask me to do more if they think it's appropriate/I'm capable. We're meant to be focusing on developing a rapport with students individually and in groups, so any advice regarding that for students aged 5-6 would be great!

Because of my ignorance, I can only imagine it being relatively easy(albeit still underpaid). 

So I am here to ask why it's so hard? I am going to talk about highschool here more than other grades.

Grading seems to be a big time sink for people. Why not assign less? Or make multiple choice stuff and do in class peer grading for homework? For essays why not just assign a 2-4 pager a week and say 5 will be graded at random(from the pool of 30 that the kids turned in). If they don't get it done on time tough luck, max grade for turning it in late is a C for participation so you don't even have to grade it at that point. 

In my head the work day could look like lectures(4 hours if you give ""independent work time"" to work on that essay) reading one essay(20-30 minuets) plus running things through the Scantron machines(20-30 minuets? I don't know), and a meeting(one hour) plus some behavior type stuff and a lesson plan (one more hour)

Sounds to me, Easy(assuming you like lectures) 7:30-4 with weekends and Summers off, no?

Because I knew I was going to be collaborating with a new team, I spent part of my summer organizing the lessons I was currently using into a more thoughtful, easy to use system that makes things really easy to find and adjust year to year.  I thought I'd share what I've done for anyone who's interested, especially since this is the time of year to think about how you want to organize things in the fall.  I work on a highly collaborative team, and we try hard to be on the same page, help each other, and improve on each other's work.  

The first thing we needed is a pacing calendar that shows approximately how many days we needed for each of our units.  I started with [this template](https://www.vertex42.com/calendars/school-calendar.html), put in the holidays, ends of quarters, and other important days (like Regents weeks in NY).  I then made a copy of the calendar for each of the courses I teach, and shared appropriate collaborating teachers for each of these courses.  Finally, I started numbering each unit and day within each unit.  For our tenth grade English class, for example, I teach four large modules and a couple of mini units.  Our Othello unit takes about 31 days with its final project.  I also included a brief description of what happens on each of these days in the calendar, but you can do this later if you'd like.  [Here's a sample of what our working pacing calendar looked like this year.](http://i.imgur.com/kfq2PlH.png)  
Each of these units corresponds to a shared folder in our team's dropbox.  Because each unit gets its own folder, it's really easy to replace these.  This year, for example, we'll probably replace the Night unit as it's consistently been our weakest unit.  [Here's what the file tree looks like.](http://i.imgur.com/UKvqMvO.png)  In each daily folder, I've placed everything I need to teach on that day:  worksheets, powerpoints, video files or links, and lesson plans.  If I need to bump a day because of a snow day or something unplanned, I simply bump everything a day on the pacing calendar (which is actually a little more annoying than it should be, but far easier than any other system I've used in the past).  It's also really easy to add a day in the middle of a unit by adding a .5 to the folder number, as I did between Othello days 12 and 13 in the example above.  Every year, we replace our weakest unit, and continue to revise our lessons to make them stronger, more relevant to the present, or to add new activities, but this system means we're never hunting for lost bits of lessons or confused about what we're teaching in our classrooms.  
If you're new to teaching, I highly recommend putting together an organizational system like this ASAP.  You'll work incredibly hard in your first few years, but you don't have to reinvent the wheel or spend hours looking for that great lesson you taught two years ago every time.  

I'd be happy to answer any questions or take suggestions about what works for others.  

Edit:  added a sentence about squeezing new days in an already working unit.  ",,6lnjuj,,0,,false,1502074232,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/6lnjuj/for_new_teachers_and_veterans_looking_for_a/,,,false,,

To make my story as short as possible: I graduated college 4 years ago with a secondary-education degree and a full intention to teach. I unexpectedly (and immediately after graduating) moved to a different state with different teaching requirements and needed a job immediately. I took the first job that was offered to me--however it is not teaching. I've been at this job for the past 4 years. It is in an educational ""setting"" (we run classes for SAT/ACT preparation) but I have been doing administrative work (I have spoken to hundreds of parents!) the last 4 years and it is unfortunately not an option for me to teach here--there is ONE teacher and that's kind of the company's ""thing"". So I have been becoming increasingly unhappy here and feel like there is so much more I can do. I want to go back to what I planned to do--to teach. I think back on my student teaching memories (which is my only ""real"" teaching experience) and they make me so happy. It's my wish to get back into a middle school classroom with all the chaos and silliness associated with that. My question to you all is, if you entered the teaching profession later in life, how did you do it? How did you transition? My initial thought it to start substitute teaching until I make contacts, but that would be exceedingly difficult unless I flat out quit my current full-time administrative job.

There is one student in particular who absolutely never wants to listen. 
I am very conflicted as to what to do. I follow another local program's facebook page and have some experience with them- they are always talking about letting kids think very independently and freely, and being comfortable as an educator with allowing the wandering kids to wander. I want to be able to do these things and help this kid especially, but he also becomes rude, lashes out, and unresponsive when any form of discipline occurs.

School policies making it difficult to discipline, not sure how to proceed.","Hi, i'm a first year teacher at a private school. I'm teaching kindergarten. I'm having some issues with the policies my school has in place regarding discipline. Basically, anything other than positive reinforcement is not allowed. I can't separate kids, have them sit out, etc. I'm having a few specific discipline issues and was wondering if any of you could help me brainstorm some ways to handle them. 


1.  We have a strict rule of no chasing games(ex-tag) on the playground, since it's easy to trip. The children all had an assembly with the principal explaining this, and so far i've been giving a reminder every day before recess. Most respect the rule, but a group of boys try their hardest to play tag every day. Typically, what I do is call them over, ask what they were playing(chasing game) ask them if they know why they're not allowed to play them(bc we can get hurt) and I brainstorm a new game for them to play that they all want to play together. 


This works fine for about 5 minutes, but as soon as they see my back turned they're back to chasing. We have an hour long recess, so i'm sure it's just as annoying for them as it is for me. I'm not sure how else to handle the issue because i'm not allowed to sit them out for not listening or separate them. 


2. We have an electronics classroom where we play storytime videos, exercise videos, sing alongs, and dance alongs. I always have issues with them talking during the videos. I tell them to be quiet during the video(~5-7 mins) and i will call on three good listeners to share what they thought about the video. This works well for a few minutes, but one child will talk and then everyone will start talking. At this point I pause the video and tell them i'm waiting on them to be quiet so we can listen. I usually have to do this about 4-5 times a video and it takes up a lot of our time in the electronics classroom. Again since I can't sit students out in not sure how to deal with the ones that keep talking(it's always the same students)


3. I have one student who is very developmentally behind and worries me. He is always in his own world and doesn't listen almost at all. It's hard because I can't bend the rules for him, because then everyone else will see that he can get away with it. For example, cleaning up. When we do stations, everybody has to help clean up. He will often just sit there, dazed off.  Even me walking up and showing him clean up time doesn't help. He also has a huge tendency to wander off and it terrifies me, especially on the playground and in line. I feel like I need another teacher just for him. He is also just emotionally immature for his age and it frustrates the other students. I'm not quite sure how to approach the situation 


Anyway, does anyone have any ideas? Thanks!

I'm an eighteen year old college freshman and I'm trying to think ahead about my options after graduating. I'll preface this with something that might be weird but I think is really relevant to this discussion - I want to be a FANTASTIC teacher. Not a good teacher. Not a decent teacher. An extraordinary teacher. For the last few years I've felt called to it, and looking at a lot of the mediocre and downright lazy English teachers I've had in high school makes me even more determined to be better. 

Since this is my goal, it follows that more education will, logically,  lead to being a more capable teacher in the sense that I'll know what I'm talking about better. In something like chemistry or math I can see a strong argument against this because none of the knowledge you gain in those upper level classes will be stuff you can realistically pass on to high schoolers, but for something like literature analysis or essay composition it's hard to see there being an upper limit on the skill of the teacher being influential for the students. 

The other main motivator is that I have the financial means to do it. I'm really lucky in terms of scholarships and college savings, and if the next three years cost around as much as the first one, I should come out of my undergrad program having used up less than half of the funds available. With a college job (which I plan to get) that should be even more money I have on hand. I also do plan to do a Master's in teaching (which I believe is a year long program at my school) before seeking employment, and I'm curious about the peace corps and other such opportunities as well. I think it would be worth my time to get some serious life experience before settling down in a classroom.

So basically the biggest issue I've seen so far is whether I'll actually be less employable with a doctorate than a bachelors because of where it puts me on the union pay scale. The last thing I want is to commit all that time and then not be able to find a job because they'd have to start me at too high a salary.

I'm curious to get your impressions on whether this is a good idea or not (I'm bracing myself for a lot of ""not"") and what your experience with the hiring market is. Also worth noting that there's a teacher shortage in my state. Don't know if that'll make a difference.

I'm not a teacher, I'm just looking for some advice.

My five year old just started kindergarten a couple weeks ago, and other than a couple bumps in the road, the transition from pre-k to k is going alright. One of these ""bumps"" was another student who was being a bit of a bully. Shortly after school started, my daughter came home saying that another kid in class had hit her. I thought it was maybe just an accident. She told me the hitter was put in time out, and I told her accidents happen, but I also went over boundaries and how we don't hit or accept getting hit if it was on purpose. No big deal. But shortly after that, she comes home from school telling me the same kid was repeatedly hitting her in the back of the head, and that she had told them to leave her alone and stop. She said that she didn't tell the teacher (idk if it was out of fear, embarrassment, or general shyness). I emailed the teacher about this and was told the two no longer sit at the same table, and that the teacher would try to reassure my daughter that it's okay to tell when someone is hurting you, so that you have help. Aside from this, the principal also called me (unprompted by me) and told me the school was trying to help this kid, and that the violence and personal space invading was unacceptable. 

After the principal called me, I realized this kid probably has more serious stuff going on than just adjusting to school and improper behavior. I also realized that they were probably giving most of the other kids in class similar treatment. I wasn't so worried about it, because it seemed like the school was invested in solving the problem.

This was all a couple weeks ago, and my daughter has been mum about the kid, so I assumed it was all taken care of. This child's mother and I have a mutual friend in common (just learned this). Through this mutual friend, I recently learned that this kid has just been taken out of school and put into a children's psych ward for evaluation and treatment. This measure was taken after the child kicked a student in the crotch, bashed an older student's head into a window, and brought a knife to school. Am I wrong for feeling like the school should have informed parents that all this violence was happening?! My god, they'll send home multiple letters about the school fund raiser, but you can't tell parents when something this serious is happening?  I understand not telling parents that this kid is in treatment, but I really do feel like they should have disclosed that this kid was assaulting other children to this degree and brought a weapon to school. What should I do (if anything) about this kid if they allow them back in? I'm hopeful that maybe the parents can find somewhere more accommodating for their situation, but I really don't want my daughter in this class if this child comes back.

A lot my kids have experienced death in their family (one even THIS morning) so a few started crying quietly. It was contagious which led to 4, then 8, then 12, then FIFTEEN of them uncontrollably crying. Sobbing loudly and hysterically.

I had so much trouble getting them to stop as they’d hear another and start going back at it. I had to get two teachers to help me.

A few weeks ago, I received a new student. This student is five years old and in kindergarten. A few months ago, one of the student's parents committed suicide. The student's living parent is young and works a low pay job to support two children and is clearly at the end of their rope. The student is very sweet and loving most of the time, but there have been some behavioral problems. If anything doesn't go this student's way (time to switch stations, art project not working out, parent coming to get them before they're ready to leave, etc.) it can quickly devolve into a full on melt down. I do my best to comfort them when they get like this, but it can be hard with 15 other students to watch. I can usually get them calmed down. I try to keep their parent in the loop with their behavior because I feel it's important that they know what's going on, and I try to spin any situation positively (""X had a little meltdown today, but I was able to talk to them and they calmed down after a couple of minutes and apologized for their behavior,"" and such), but when I talk to the parent, the student will often get upset and begin to cry and scream that we're mad at them. Last week, they were nearly inconsolable and their parent clearly had no idea how to help calm them down. I was eventually able to essentially get myself between parent and child and calm them down, because they were both freaking each other out. Parent thanked me for being so good with the student and I explained that I am a certified teacher and that my reason for getting into teaching was to advocate for children. Parent expressed that they were so happy that they ended up at my daycare because of how well I am with the student.

I'm doing everything I know how to do in a situation that no one ever really prepared me for (a student dealing with the recent death of a parent), and obviously the school the student attends is also helping by having the student meeting with the counselor three times a week and working on getting them into another program to help manage their emotional reaction to situations outside of their control. But is there anything else I could be doing to help this student and their parent? My heart is so heavy for both of them and I want to support them however I can with the limited position I'm in.

I think I interact well with the students, and I've had previous teachers and professors tell me that I'm a natural and they're not worried about me, based on how I interact with students and tach small lessons/guided reading groups. Whenever I'm being observed though, I just feel like my lessons are terrible. Today I read a book to the students after a short recess, and to be honest it was kind of a fail. Like reading a book was a fail. It didn't help that not only was the teacher watching, but so was a counselor and a parent. It just seems like such a stupid issue. It wasn't a behavioral problem, all the students were listening and only needed a bit of reminding to stay quiet. It's just that I was kind of awkward when reading it and asking questions, even looking up to my mentor teacher once for for silent affirmation of the definition of cultivate (of all things).

Basically, my issue is I'm terrible at being observed.

I recently took the same position at a different, much smaller and brand new STEM school in the district. The new principal wants me to explore Microsoft 365. Here’s some background: 

The district uses D2L as its LMS but recently G Suite is becoming a huge favorite among teachers. The powers that be don’t really like G Suite. They claim their hesitation is for student data security reasons, but the feeling among staff is they actually don’t want to look dumb by spending a bunch of money on D2L when Google can do most (not all) of their services for free. Teachers are unrelenting, though, so the district made the shortsighted decision to allow individual schools to create their own G Suite domains a couple of years ago. Now, we’re slowly moving to a district domain. This is good because I don’t have to manage it anymore, but they have turned off Gmail, Sites, and Classroom. We’re all fighting for those services, but no one knows if/when they’ll be turned on. 

My new principal wants me to explore Microsoft 365 as a Google replacement. I love G Suite, but he feels that he doesn’t want to use it if the county is going to poopoo it. My main concerns with 365 is that it will cost money at our local school and that we will be the only school in a district of 200 schools who will use it.

So here are my questions:

- Have you used G Suite and 365? What are the similarities and differences/advantages and disadvantages?

- Do you think there is actual concern with student data security in G Suite, and is it more concerning that any that exists with 365?

- The new school is starting off primarily with Lenovo laptops for student use, though Lenovo Chromebooks are popular in my district. Is that a consideration one way or the other?

- What else haven’t I considered?",,7v8rdw,,0,,false,1520487225,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7v8rdw/g_suite_vs_microsoft_365_xpost_from_redtech/,,,,,

I moved here because I wanted a new experience, but it's been pretty rough. I handed in my resignation two weeks ago (and will most likely leave teaching as a whole after the year)

When I first got hired they told me I'd be the assistant coach for the high school boys' soccer team, and head coach for the girls' team. I was like cool. Then they had fewer boys sign up than expected, so the assistant position was done away with. Then I found out this was actually the first year for the soccer program at the high school, I'd have to set it up for the girls, and a good chunk of the girls would probably need to be taught how to play. The pay for it isn't worth mentioning. When interviews came around in the fall for the girls' head coach, (there were a couple of other candidates up for it), I respectfully declined, because in addition to what I mentioned, I was also having a tough time fitting into my school. The assistant principal at the high school (who is in charge of sports there) wasn't happy and would blow me off at PDs, meetings, etc. To me, the decision was simple: I love soccer, but I do not want to stress myself out over setting up a soccer program, teaching the players how to play, low pay, and basically sacrificing my own hobbies for this

The ESL teacher at my school ended up taking the position instead. Today at our staff meeting she mentioned she was selling mugs for their team fundraiser (one more reason I'm glad I didn't do it, they didn't tell me this was part of the job, and apparently didn't tell her either until the time to raise money came). The principal goes ""Yeah she was basically forced into this"" and glanced at me. I was about ready to tell him to kiss my ass

It's already been an unenjoyable year for me (my kids are great, admin is not), and I've felt better since turning in my resignation letter. But Christ, it's like they're determined to show me why I won't be missing this place when I'm gone

Is going into a post-bacc teaching program a smart decision?,"Hey everyone! My name is Carey and I am new to Reddit and the teaching subreddit. I would love some advice from current teachers.

My background: I am 23 years old and living in Washington state. I just graduated in December with a bachelors in Communication Studies and a minor in history. I loved my major, but I'm feeling stuck because I am in a lot of student debt and am having a lot of trouble finding jobs that I am qualified for despite my educational background. Additionally, I have a lot of other financial hurdles. I am currently working a full-time job at minimum wage and living on my own and paying for everything myself: rent, phone bill, utilities, etc. I also am wanting to save up for my very first car, and sadly, driving lessons, which are quite expensive- my parents did not help me learn to drive when I turned 16, and although I have my instruction permit and some practice with helpful friends, it hasn't been enough to acquire a license. Now that I am working full-time, this is my chance to save up enough money to do this.

I have been working with children since I turned 16 and have generally enjoyed it. I currently am working as a support teacher at a local preschool and have enjoyed learning about curriculum and early childhood education. This has led me to consider going back to school and earning a teaching certification to possibly teach elementary, preferably K-3. I am hesitant, however, for these reasons:

-Although I have worked with kids for years and enjoy it (and find it generally fulfilling), I do not know if I have a natural ability for it or a ""calling"" as they say
-I am not a very organized person
-I want to be able to live comfortably on my own, and I am not sure if teaching will provide that type of income, although it would be much better than what I have right now
-The job seems pretty high stress due to administration struggles and parents, and I struggle with anxiety issues

Any advice? I am scared of taking on more debt and am worried that teaching will not be a passion for me, even though I enjoy working with kids, have a lot of experience, and enjoy learning.

I am concerned about some “communal areas” like the wardrobe for example, where the teachers are not present and a mix of students with a big difference in age could maybe be problematic.

(Rant.)","I recently finished my first year as a middle school History teacher and high school football and track coach (my middle school is a ""magnet"" attached to the high school for various reasons, and is self sufficient in many ways but dependent on the HS for quite a bit as well.) It was a long, rough year but I didn't face any crazy problems that many new teachers face and I even managed to have the highest standardized test scores in my district for my 8th grade students. Classroom wise, everything was a success.

However, other aspects of the job have left me in a slump. I love my kids, but I didn't have much of a chance to build any kind of relationships (professional or otherwise) with any other teachers at my campus until the last few weeks of school when things had slowed down a bit (after testing.) 

The coaches I worked with were all very chummy as many of them had been together for years, but now most of them have been fired (new athletic director) and I'm not going to be coaching with most of them next year anyways (as I've been ""demoted"" to middle school football.) They were also, for the most part, considerably older and their lives revolved around sports and coaching whilst mine doesn't. Coaching is a lower priority to me compared to my classroom instruction, and this doesn't seem to be the norm for most coaches (as usually they are hired as coaches first; I was hired as a teacher and they just have me plugged in to fill some coaching holes.) The younger coaches are all about partying and drinking in their free time, whereas I'm more of a...nerd? I like to have game nights, jam, etc.

I also have a family, and that's a big part of my life. Huge, actually. My wife and almost two year old son are the center of my universe. I love spending time with them.

Anyways, getting to the point: I don't have any ""friends"" aside from my wife and my son. I was studious to a fault in college and kept my circle of peers pretty small, and most of them went on to stay in school and chase their Master's or PhD. We just kind of...split up. Different life paths: I chose to settle down and raise a family. However, it's TOUGH just dealing with kids/teens all day. I don't really interact with any adults in a meaningful non-work-related way. I miss being a ""person."" 

I'm half way through my summer off and I'm miserable. I don't DO anything all day. My wife works and my son is in day care most of the time (we get lots of time together, too, so that's not an issue.) I literally just mope around the house.

I used to be really involved in the local community theatre, but I can't do that anymore due to my coaching schedule (which I hate, and hopefully in a few years I can transition into just teaching.) I was in a band on and off until recently, but school and family commitments made it hard for me to work them into the schedule so that didn't work either.

My wife and I don't have any friends who are at this point in their lives. The people we know are either too busy partying, or are 15-20 years our seniors. 

Again, I've gotten off track, but...has anybody struggled with this? I'm miserable pretty often because I finally have the time, money and ability to spend quality time with people and I feel alone. My wife is awesome, and she's my best friend, but sometimes I want to hang out with someone else and do the things I want to do that she doesn't want to do. She, at least, seems other human adults at work every day. She has adult friends and acquaintances (but we tend not to hang out with them too often because, again, they are either party-goers or septuagenarians [she works in a library.])

Anyways, I was just hoping to see if any other teachers have felt this pang of frustration.

Makes sense. Fewer students do not need the same amount of teachers. I thought we'd be okay.

We don't have a ton of teachers leaving my department (English) this year but one teacher leaving, who teaches the same level as I do, has meant that all of us in that level are having more kids piled onto our load.

In 2003 I inherited — as I did throughout my childhood — a pile of used textbooks from my elder sister. I was about to start grade 11, two years from finishing school and starting college. Along with hundreds of thousands of students in India I was to appear for the IITJEE, the famously difficult exam you need to take to get into one of the Indian Institutes of Technology (or IITs), India’s premier science and engineering colleges.

What was different about this pile as compared to the previous decade or so was that it was full of “extra” reading. I now had at least five textbooks for each of Chemistry, Physics and Math. My sister gave me the low-down on what I had to do to prepare for Physics.

“The school textbook is very basic. Resnick &amp; Halliday is great, but it doesn’t use the metric system. I.E. Irodov is too complex, even by IITJEE standards. But whatever you do, do read H.C. Verma.”

And so I did. As have millions of others over the years, due almost entirely to word-of-mouth recommendations. In India, private tutoring or ‘coaching’ for IITJEE and other engineering examinations is an industry worth billions of dollars. Despite the consequent abundance of reference texts and narrow-minded partisan interests that govern what content is pushed upon a populace desperate to crack the exam, H.C. Verma’s book is often the first recommendation from a teacher to a student. Concepts of Physics is among India’s, and indeed the world’s most read textbooks for high school Physics.

It took Professor H.C. Verma 8 years to write the two volumes that made him a household name. And now they seem to pop up in places where you least expect them to. You might find a copy lying next to the monthly edition of Vogue at a railway station bookstore, or even in the odd mainstream Bollywood movie.

A year before the IITJEE exam, I started studying under India’s other great high school Physics textbook author — Mr. D.C. Pandey — whose own series of textbooks are the closest thing to competition for Concepts of Physics… although I doubt either of them cares about such trifles. Tongue firmly in cheek, Mr. D.C. Pandey once told us that Concepts of Physics was “the second best Physics textbook in the world”.

For the uninitiated, here’s a marker of the textbooks’ enduring quality and stunning popularity.

Number of years since the first edition was published: 25
Rank on Amazon’s list of best-selling books in India (as on July 20, 2017): 25

Better than any other textbook across subjects, levels and languages, even though sales at small stores far outstrip those through online retail. Concepts of Physics is more than just a textbook in India. Some call it the Gita, Bible or Quran of Physics. Others call the Gita, Bible and Quran the Concepts of Physics of their religions.

I have a student that's having trouble reading. It's in French, but the problem seems like it could just as easily happen if she were learning in English. She can tell individual sounds apart, but can't put them together. She'll sit with a word and put the sounds closer and closer together and go:

&gt; m....... ou..... m.... ou.... m.. ou.. mat!

If it's not a real word that she can memorize, she can't read it, and it's clear she's not reading the words she knows, she's just memorized them and guesses based on some of the letters and the length. 

I've tried using a page where it only changes the first letter (cou, mou, lou, gou, dou) and she'll recognize some, but seems incapable of seeing the pattern. She'll go through a list of like 20 words and just stop in the middle and change it (""mou, gou, nou, pou, vou, jou, rou... uh, say?""). We've had discussion about how ""ou"" make an ""oo"" sound, and all that, but it's just not working. We've tried pulling out manipulative letters, making letters with playdough, all that. She can tell what a letter is, what sound it makes, but can't put them together to make words. If you segment the words into syllables, she can make each individual sound, but then when she has to put it together to make a word, she just guesses.

EDIT: So after talking with a teaching partner, we are starting to think it may be deficit in phonological awareness. She also struggles with recognizing words that rhyme.

Here's my question: as a white woman who grew up surrounded by privilege, who would I better serve--a community similar to my own or one very different than my own, but one that has more need? I think I would be better prepared to teach students whose experiences I can understand, but at the same time, those aren't the students who *need* teachers.

Asking for any advice ya'll might have on managing a class made up of 98% extremely disruptive 6th grade boys. There is a mountain of other problems but I really want to get this under control first. I am a first year teacher which I know is a big part of this, but also, I teach 4 5th grade classes and 1 6th grade. My planning is right after 6th grade class and at this school curriculum is only life science for 6th grade as they rotate sciences through each middle school year. I have no time to prepare for my 6th grade student's lessons unless it is only notes or handouts... I am so lost and have been using the other 6th grade science teacher's plans (although I am grateful, he teaches very different than me and they are often last minute). He kind of wants me to be on my own now but I am still trying to get a handle on my 5th grade...I am so overwhelmed and anxious I completely shut down and seriously contemplated quitting. Anyway, admin completely changed my 6th grade class after the first week and a half of school. It started wonderfully, I had 4 boys (3 incredibly sweet and mature boys might I add) and one girl and only one boy was a minor challenge. They took 2 of the kids that I connected most with out of my class and replaced them with 9 disruptive loud, disrespectful boys (and one girl recently was added this week) and still the one girl who is quiet and sweet. Class every day is complete chaos. I almost broke down in class the other day. Keep in mind this is my first year, I still have never been told straight from admin that I was even teaching 6th grade. I found out officially the weekend before school started. The class is very small (11 students). but is by fair my worst and 5th grade as a whole is quite challenging (many many behavior problems, almost all below grade level, and lots of sped and 504-with no support or even documentation telling me how to legally provide) I might just be venting, idk. I was going to start a tally system on Monday... please help. I have anxiety (severe right now) and ADHD inattentive type  (just started meds for both) and I really don't know if I can do this. Thanks.

EDIT: Well....thank all of you SO much for the advice, I really took it to heart and was ready to implement some strategies. However, now admin has decided to take my 11 kiddos and absorb them into the other science teacher's classes. I will not have a 6th grade class any longer! I will miss them, a little haha. They'll still be in the building over! As a first year this is huge. I can now focus on 5th grade and DEL lessons as well as content so we can get behavior under some sort of control. Thank you everyone for the encouragement!

She never used to participate in this while she was in school and interning and seemed to crop up nearly two months ago, seemingly right when she started her new teaching position. One thing I pointed out to her was that her being a teacher, and a first year teacher at that, was that if she got a dui, she could very well lose her teaching position and that because she has a family at home, her bar hopping and clubbing needs to end and is borderline inappropriate. When I brought this up to her, she shrugged and basically said her employer can't dictate her social life. 

I realize this is the r/teaching sub, but I wanted to post this question to those that are teachers and see if I crossed the line with my fiancé for saying she was acting inappropriate.

I may be posting to the wrong place but I'm somewhat lost on where I should ask these questions. I'm currently a conscript in the Korean army and I've been recently handed a job to teach Korean soldiers English! Great opportunity not only for me but also for the soldiers who are looking to expand their horizons once they get discharged.

Now, I've taught English before but not in a formal setting. By formal setting, I mean in a ""classroom setting"" which makes things difficult. Moreover, I've taught English(TOEFL/TOEIC/etc) to students who already had some intermediate amount of experience with English which made my job easier. 

I'm going to teach anywhere from 4 to 10 students every day for an hour in a room, most of whom have extremely varied 'beginner' level English experience. As much as I'd like to individually help every student in accordance with their English proficiency level, I'm not given the leisure of time to do so.

I'm currently lost on how I should teach all these people at once. Currently, I'm going through the following things with the students:

* Daily Vocabulary. (15 ~ 20 words per day) 
-Mixed difficulty but nothing too hard.
-Forming sentences with said vocabulary.
-Looking to increase to 40 ~ 50 words per day in the future.

* Speaking (pronunciation practice of vocabulary learned)
-Me or my students peaking sentences made during Vocab practice.

* Listening (listening practice of vocabulary learned)
-Again, either me or my students speaking sentences made during Vocab practice then listening.

(Speaking and listening are going hand in hand for this one)

The issue is that officers who put me up to the job want a sort of an objective. A visible marker of improvement over time and while this does improve their English skills over time, it's not much for TOEFL/TOEIC/IELTs. 

An issue with this is that I'm (for the foreseeable future) not allowed to bring educational materials (i.e. books) from outside. Some stuff regarding safety and stuff, not really sure why books aren't allowed but the military isn't budging on my pleas.

I'd like to hear a teacher's opinion or guideline on how I can make better use of the time I have and as to where I should have my focus on. 

Would also be a really big help to have some guidance on resources I should be using.

I have many friends who are elementary school teachers and they told me that they wanted an app that would let them have quick and easy access to information about their students such as which ones are in the GATE program, their reading and math levels, and which ones need special accommodations. When you have a class of more than 30 students, it is hard to keep all of this in your head, particularly at the start of the year. With the Class Coach app, you can gather all the most important info about students from various sources/files and keep it all in one place on your phone in a fun and easy to use way. It is useful to have with you at meetings, when trying to group students for an activity, or when planning lessons. 

If you think this app would be useful for you and are browsing reddit on your iphone, you can get a direct link to the app on the App Store (currently iOS only) by clicking the following link:

As a man, I initially thought that my realm of teaching would be limited to secondary school (my chosen subject would be English). All the societal messages seemed to dictate such; teaching young kids is often portrayed as women's work. 

But I've had experience teaching kids in a wide range of ages--from 3 all the way to 18. Although I sometimes enjoyed teaching the teenagers, I connect WAY better with young kids. Teens, in general, seem to have attitudes that I don't jive with. A lot of the time, they're apathetic, melodramatic, or act like they're worldly and wise when they're not. I consider myself a big kid at heart, and my personality is of the exuberant, enthusiastic, playful kind. Perhaps unsurprisingly, my experiences teaching young kids have always been my favorite. 

I heard a piece of advice from a teacher when choosing which age to teach, and she said, ""Pick the age group that you would genuinely feel happy to wake up and teach every day."" Hands down, for me, it's young kids.

I want to do work that makes me happy and that makes an important impact, so I have officially decided to pursue elementary education as my career...but my only remaining qualm is that several people have said: ""Don't do it. The parents will think you're a pedo, and if there are any accusations (no matter how fabricated and ridiculous), your life could easily go down the toilet.""

I don't know what to think of that. Should this really be a cause for concern? If there are other male elementary teachers on here, have you ever encountered this attitude from parents, school staff, etc? How did you deal with it, if you did?

I had a plan that more or less had been working, not exactly as planned but still. 

I left Brazil on February to come to Russia and work as a ""volunteer"", teaching English and Portuguese in a city south of Moscow. It work out at first, but soon the cultural differences regarding the educational process and methodology became apparent to the point where I decided to leave the school (not gonna go into details about that unless necessary for comprehension and advice).

Back in Brazil I had a pretty good career prospect at a law firm, translating patents, and also as a conference interpreter - things that I had to stop doing once I arrived. The time difference and workload took care of that.

Not long ago I was offered a position at another language institute in the Siberia region, paid, work paper provided and they would also provide an apartment for no cost at all. It seemed simply perfect, and I embraced this opportunity.

However, in order to make any changes to one visa status one must leave the country and request the new visa elsewhere. I talked to the folks at the institute and we agreed that they would sent my invitation letter to Moldova, where I would apply at the Russian embassy for the work visa. Why Moldova? Well, my girlfriend has been living there, so it just seemed easier, pleasant and cheap. 

I applied for the Moldovan visa, got it in one or two days and went there with no further delays at the beginning of October. The invitation was supposed to arrive by the 10th - but it didn't until the 25th, which was the last available I had in the country before my visa expires (I tried to extent it but they didn't accept it for ""lack of reason""). 

I left Moldova with my invitation and no time to go to the Russian embassy and apply for the visa. As a Brazilian, I can enter Russia and stay here for 90 days without any problems, and that's what I did. I planned to stay here for about 3 days, apply for the Moldovan visa again, go there and get my shit done in a week-ish time period. 

As it is now, they have not issued the visa yet, they haven't answered any of my emails (which they did within hours of difference at the end of September), the Russian embassy doesn't pick up the phone when I call or reply emails, my budget is reaching it's limit and I have no way of getting an income without this freaking work visa.

I emailed the institute explaining the situation and asking if it would be okay to go there and just do some work as a ""volunteer"" for this period, thing that was suggested, in the first place, by them, and received the following answer: I have to talk to the director (which for me at least implies that they are probably gonna deny this request).

Now I'm in Moscow feeling pretty much like Ton Hanks in the movie ""The Terminal"". Any suggestions/advice? Anyone based in Moscow with a cheaper-than-my-current-hostel place to stay or a ""volunteer"" job that could give me something to do and an income for the time being? 

I'd like to say that I'm calm and can see a light at the end of this, but I'm not, I don't and I won't until (if) I have a positive answer about the job over there or any other doable possibility.

Thanks for reading all of this, it definitely went longer than I expected.

I have a lot of heavy hitters in one fourth grade class. While I feel like I’m struggling, we at least get to the point of learning and they respect me. This isn’t the case with the specialists — my kids just don’t care and are extremely rude and inhibit any learning. 

(For example, in Spanish they are still learning to introduce themselves. In music, the teacher was considering having them not perform the concert while everyone else was ready to)

I’ve been called over the loudspeaker to “rescue” the specialist, and administration has gotten involved but doesn’t have the greatest follow-through. My kids have straight up yelled at the specialists and said some pretty nasty things. And these are some VERY seasoned teachers and some veterans so it’s not management practices, either. 

I am going to try doing restorative justice circles as our current social-emotional curriculum is not working. But I’m wondering, what are solutions (aka punishments) for hurting the relationships with specialists? We’ve already done things like writing letters, missing recess, and those actions are not effective.

The school I'm at has changed a lot since I got my job offer late last year, and the job so far has not been what I've expected.

I'm finding the workload incredibly difficult and the seemingly never-ending nature of the job is making me unwell. I'm choosing to ignore tasks like regular marking and making phone-calls home, as I simply don't have the time. I've recently had a couple of panic attacks and frequent vomiting which a doctor has attributed to my stress at work.

On top of that, I'm simply not enjoying teaching the students as much as I thought I would. I work in a deprived area so the students can be difficult and frequently I have to alter my lessons accordingly. But I'm also not enjoying teaching the content itself and I'm not sure if I would with any class.

There are some bright spots - my form group are lovely students and I enjoy having more informal conversations with them. There are bright sparks in every class who are keen to be at school and in my classroom. And the department I work in is friendly and has been supportive when I've mentioned my struggles so far.

Nevertheless, my overwhelming feeling on a work day is dread and I feel that I am too young (early 20s) to be hating my work so much.

I know this is absolutely not true, yet my wife gets sent home from work, and the district has to investigate... Thankfully Toxic isn't smart enough to use the name of an actual student or parent.

Before that I had jobs in restaurants. 

I graduated 3 years ago with an associates degree in general transfer studies paid for by scholarship. I wanted and want to transfer into university, and I mentally went through many majors while in school and since I’ve been out of school, and have come down to either teaching or business.

I actually already signed up for classes in spring for business, but now am second guessing because I always thought teaching would make for a meaningful and nice life for me. I see pros and cons to both.

Business pros:
- more salary potential
- easier to find a job
- already working in business
- many field options (marketing, supply chain are my interests)
- my current job will reimburse tuition 50% if I study a subject with a plan to stay with them
- 8-5 Monday through Friday job and family friendly with holidays off is important to me
- my sister is a very successful supply chain manager who likes to mentor me

Business cons:
- can be draining
- sitting in a cubicle all day
- all about making money 

Teaching pros: 
- meaningful career
- energizing being around kids all day
- people consistently say I am driven, kind, compassionate, incredibly patient, smart, helpful, organized, resourceful and efficient which are all good teacher qualities 
- chance to be creative
- impact a lot of lives and leave a legacy

Teaching cons:
- less pay
- I am an introvert who sometimes lacks social skills, and am not sure if being a teacher would be a little torturous considering that
- I haven’t been around kids too much and am sometimes awkward and unsure of how to interact but I would like to get better
- on my feet all day
- lesson planning and grading would take up personal time 
- I struggle with depression and social anxiety at times and this would be hard to manage being a teacher I feel, but maybe it would also help with those issues

TLDR: What do you think? I want to have a career that I can throw my all into and devote myself and ignite a passion for.

I teach at-risk students at a Title I school, as you may see from my previous post. And title.

This week, I was able to facilitate an interest in reading from more than half of my students! Actually, more than half. Not only that, but I removed their game days (I used to have what was called 'Fun Fridays' where we played vocab/grammar/review games) to do so!

There was a bit of grumbling...Well, A LOT of grumbling, but by the first break, I had students begging me to give them more time to read!

I teach seniors, and many of them can count the amount of books they've read in their lifetime on one hand. 90% of my students read on a 5th grade level, yet many of them even left the classroom discussing what they read...Without any facilitation! (Swoon!)

I've really been needing a day like this. And this is more than I could ever wish for. It took a lot of work and setting up a class culture that would ensure students would have a quiet space where they can focus on reading for pleasure. Everything I've been working for so far this year finally came together in a way that made me tear up.

That overshadowed an already absolutely incredible return from break. The first assignment coming back to school was to write about a life lesson or moral that they have learned (to be used in a future assignment). One of my students I had last year (taught juniors last year) wrote, ""I've learned to be grateful to people who love you even if they don't have money to get you gifts. You need to be self-sufficient (yes! That exact term!) and not depend on anyone for anything"".

I asked if I could read his in particular to my other classes (knowing him and his backstory). He told me he didn't mind and that he was willing to share it all with the class. Then, he got up and read his paper and talked about how his mom was gunned down on Christmas and that his grandma couldn't afford gifts this year. 

Should I faint? I should probably faint. It's like something out of a movie.

I'm trying to focus on days like these. It's so easy to brush passed them as there's so much to do and work towards. So many stories and situations, so little time to respond adequately to all of them.

This has really put me off of choosing this for my future. I do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling under pressure like I do now experiencing high levels of anxiety which is forever getting worse because of the pressures.

Behaviour management is what I struggle most with and I have observed numerous lessons a D picked up on numerous methods for dealing with behaviour but my subject mentor is never happy. And the things they tell me to do conflict massively with what I observe in every lesson I go to. I try my utter hardest and I feel at this point they've given up on me. I feel completely in the dark and they just seem content to complain about me and watch me crash and burn at the end of my placement. I desperately wanted to be a teacher and I just feel like the support I needed has been non existent. I'm back in therapy, I spend most evenings hiding under my bed wishing things would just end and I remain far too meek to even try and bring my problems up with the university. Which has ultimately left me in the position when I'm almost certain to fail. Another year of my life wasted. I'm lost. Just completely lost.

I teach third grade

The one thing I've always wondered, that nobody has given me a reasonable response to, is why we keep passing kids on to the next grade. I have students who barely read at a second grade level. Those same students can barely do subtraction and double/triple digit addition (my class is supposed to start division next week. I have a group of kids who couldn't solve 24 - 9 yesterday without taking several minutes)

Teachers consistently get beat over the head about ""differentiation"" and ""meeting students where they're at"", but yikes, what's the point of having these students in third grade if they're not at a third grade level? What's the point of teaching a third grade curriculum if nearly half my kids struggle with second grade concepts?

We basically move these kids on despite them clearly needing more help/work, and tell the next teacher ""It's your responsibility now"". And the process just cycles

Is there a solution to this? I know a lot of people are against retention at older grades because it might hurt a kid's self esteem, but shoot, what's worse, a kid's self esteem temporarily being affected, or letting a kid continue ""passing"" grades while clearly not being ready to move on?

I honestly don't understand the logic behind just letting kids go to the next grade when they're completely unfit to do so. Does admin want their numbers to look good? Do we not have the courage to tell parents we need to hold their kids back?

I've also gotten along great with the rest of the kindergarten teachers, and my mentor teacher and I are pretty friendly. Despite this, my mentor teaching doesn't really seem able to mentor me and it's absolutely killing my confidence.

To start, she is super successful and therefore is in a lot of leadership or supportive positions around the school, which leaves us with basically no time to talk. For example, today I had to remind her that I'm supposed to be taking over math next week. She's a fantastic teacher so I can see why she's needed everywhere, but I feel that my own student teaching experience is less effective because we don't have enough time to plan out my lessons before she has to get her kids or go to a meeting. For example, I'm about to go into my 5th week and I've only taught about 3 lessons.

I think she's also nervous to turn her class over and give me more control. She never student taught (she did the alternate route) and because of that I think that she really doesn't know what to expect or why it's so important that I get some time to practice teaching. I get that it must be really difficult to leave your class for a few weeks, but it absolutely kills my confidence when she says she nervous, even jokingly. I know I'm not teacher of the year, but I never will be if I cant practice and get more experience being in front of a class.

This all came to a head when my teacher needed an immediate sub the other day. One teacher overheard and said that last year the last student teacher subbed for her mentor teacher for a few days on her second week at the school, even though she didn't have a license. My mentor then commented that she would let me sub but I don't have my sub license, and the other teacher told her that the last student teacher didn't either. Basically it was super awkward and though I know the other teacher didn't mean for it to sound that way, it really made me feel like literal trash. 

Basically I haven't been able to teach much, and even with slowly increasing responsibilities planned, I can tell my ct is reluctant to hand over more control of her class. How do I help make us both more comfortable with these transitions?

I’m literally at my wits end and feel very unsafe and unsupported, please help. [long, maybe epic]","I’m not sure I can deal with it much longer. The inmates are running the asylum and they know it. 

Let me paint the picture:
7th period, last class of the day. I have some of my best and worst students in this class. 2 girls who are BFFs are the bane of my existence. They routinely disrupt, disrespect, and scoff at myself and their fellow students. Yelling across the class room, cussing at and threatening other students, that’s the short list.  I have had one of them removed before and spoken to them about their behavior. 

NONE of their behavior, even though it’s repeated time and time again, is a referable offense. I wrote a corrective behavior report like I’m supposed to had had them sign. They laughed and knew nothing was going to happen, and that even if I wrote a referral it might magically disappear. 

Oh yes you read that right. Referrals (things that help us CYA and implement discipline) magically disappear at our school. And all the students know it. Only referrals deemed important enough are processed. I have written about 5 referrals this year (so obviously not a crazy referral lady, there would have been so many more at any other school) and only received 1 that got processed and the others have disappeared. I didn’t get feedback, I didn’t get told if it was an unreferable offense, nothing. Poof, gone like magic. 

I’m far from the only teacher who this happens to, another story. My room neighbor had to have a girl removed from her classroom for being disrespectful and a multitude of other things. It stemmed from the girl sitting in a seat other than her assigned one and cheating/on her phone. The teacher asked over and over again for her to move, she refused. Now, this doesn’t seem like a big deal, except it’s February and this student has been this way all year she has multiple referrals to prove it. The teacher calls for her to be removed from the classroom and assistance shows up. The girl wouldn’t leave until school police came. 

But that’s not the end of it. The student manages to slip the police and leave campus. She returns to campus and makes it all the way back to our classrooms (the highest, 3rd floor, and furthest hallway from the entrance to school) and threatens the teachers life. THIS GIRL IS NOT SUSPENDED OR ANYTHING!!!!! The multiple referrals she should have had, never processed. She looks like a great student on paper. Administration and guidance said it would look bad to punish her or change her teacher since she’ll be moving to a new school in the future. ALL MY WHATS!?!!?

If that’s not something that deserves discipline I don’t know that does. I don’t feel save or secure at work, I’m miserable, I haven’t cried this much in years. I don’t know what to do and I’m at my wits end. 

SOS, please send help I’m drowning.

They are 20 years old and haven't really picked up on much math at all.  They need to take an Accuplacer test since they are going to go to a community college soon.  I asked them if they had trouble memorizing formulas (they don't know how to find the area of a circle), and they said yes, so I will probably use a lot of flashcards.  I feel like it could be tough to make a lot of concepts sink in, especially if I don't make it fun (math has always been fun for me, but I'm sure some people need it to be a game for it to be fun).  It sounds like they have a somewhat good grasp of basic arithmetic, but I'm not sure if they know anything past that.  The college-level part of the Accuplacer test has the following 6 subject areas:

1.) Algebraic Operations - like manipulating roots and exponentials, simplifying rationals, factoring/expanding.

2.) Solutions of Equations and Inequalities - kind of self-explanatory

3.) Coordinate Geometry - graphs, straight lines, sets of points, and perhaps some conics.

The next 3 might be too hard for her:

4.) Applications and Other Algebra Topics - includes Complex Numbers, series and sequences (isn't this calc 2 stuff?? I'm surprised), determinants (linear algebra??), permutations and combinations, factorials, and word problems.

6.) Trigonometry - just basic trigonometric functions I guess.

TLDR: This is my first time tutoring, and I need a lot of good resources for the above subjects.  Does anyone have any math game suggestions?  I mean all I can think of at the moment is a silly multiplication table game, where I say a number like 56 and they have to think of which numbers multiply to it.  Sorry if this is the wrong sub.

Help please ��,"I was recently let go from my teaching job for political reasons. Even though I got highly effective but either way not my question. My question is this.. I commute about 2 hours for this job and it’s been hard. So tonight there is a “moving up” ceremony that I was never informed was mandatory.  And although it’s a half day if you haven’t accumulated two hours of extra pd time, you have to stay until 3:50 and then show up to the night ceremony. For me this will be absolutely ridiculous, I would be here from 8am all the way to 11 at night and then wake up and come back. As much as “suck it up” is clearly an answer, I’ve been struggling with severe anxiety with this job and I’ve been having severe panic attacks here every morning.  Also I don’t have any clothes for this ceremony tonight because I thought that I didn’t have to go. Considering I’m not rehired for next year should I just leave for the half day and then come back for the ceremony? Or just leave. I made the mistake of asking the principal and she said it was mandatory. Better to ask for forgiveness than taking no for an answer I’ve heard. But since I’m such a rule follower if I go against the rules it makes me feel anxious as well. At this point should I even care? I’m not going back into teaching so do you think it might worsen a reference?

A couple of weeks ago, I ran into a former student of mine at a social event, completely randomly -- there was no one else there related to my or her time at the school in any way.

We've been texting since then, and it feels like she's interested. She's gotten really attractive, and seems like she has a cool personality. But the ethics feel a little bit questionable to me. The last time I saw her, I was 24 and she was 13. I'm now 29, and she's 18.

I'm pretty conflicted about it because it's not like I've manipulated her in any way, or had designs on her when she was a kid, or anything like that. Ending up in this situation was basically random chance. On the other hand, if I'm totally honest with myself, there is some extra appeal because it's ""forbidden"" or ""bad,"" and while that is hot as a fantasy, the fact that it's occurring to me about a real situation makes me feel like a total creep and just want to ghost on her completely.

I'd really love to just have someone tell me it's fine and to go for it, see where it goes and not worry about it -- but at the same time I'm not really sure what the ethical reasoning justifying that would be. On the other hand, as far as reasons it's not OK, I also don't know what the reasoning is beyond just a vague and general sense of ""ick,"" since I haven't done anything manipulative, predatory, or inappropriate to end up in this position and am no longer a teacher.

What do you guys think? I could use some teacher perspectives on it. I'm gonna take a day or two off texting her to think about it before I proceed.


**EDIT (FOLLOW-UP):** Thanks to everyone who responded. I got some really good perspective, and I'm glad I asked, because I've managed to really pin down what is and isn't wrong with it, instead of just having vague hazy concepts.

For what it's worth I am not going to pursue this relationship. I'm going to have a frank (text) conversation with her explaining that while it was exciting and fun to text with her and entertain the possibility, and while I find her attractive, I did some soul-searching and don't feel like it'd be fair to her to take it any further. I'll probably apologize for leading her on and wasting her time before coming to this conclusion, and then wish her well and try to focus on hopefully meeting someone new soon.

I work with the high school students one on one.   Many of my students speak only English.  

So far, I have been focusing mostly on word roots and connections to first languages as a tool for more quickly expanding vocabulary,  strategies to figure out unknown words, metacognitive reading strategies, and general study strategies and study skills.

I feel a little lost, though- I trust that these things will make some difference to students' reading comprehension, because I think they would be effective for any student, but I am not sure I am getting at the root of their difficulty with reading and performance in content-areas- instead I feel like I'm teaching them ways to compensate for a lower English proficiency. 

It also often seems like sometimes the students already know these strategies, and I am not sure whether it is going outside the bounds of my role to focus on things like study skills and motivation.

1. I'm only making a lesson plan to last a week rather than an entire year/quarter/semester

The guidelines presented below were informed by the widely-acclaimed abuse prevention program of organization Darkness to Light as well as peer-reviewed studies by Cushman (2005), Andrzejewski (2006), Newberry (2007), Stronach (2008) and several others.



=========
Child Abuse
=========



Child sexual abuse is an extremely tricky problem to combat, largely because of the unparalleled level of emotion involved in cases and the secretive nature of the crimes. One of the biggest problems is that there are few concrete facts and definitions associated with the problem out there, so let's get a few basic ones out of the way first:

1. A pedophile is someone who desires explicit sexual contact with pre-pubescent children. This is defined as physical contact with the breasts, buttocks or genitals (clothed or unclothed), oral contact with a child on any part of their body, and/or coercing a child to perform explicit sexual acts on themselves or someone else.
    
2. The ""bathing suit area"" refers to the area of a child's body that should always be deemed off-limits to the touches of others. The concrete rule must be: No physical contact between an adult and a child, or a child and another child, should involve the bathing suit area outside of a strict and supervised medical context.

3. Most child sexual abuse is committed by people known by the child and their family. Parents, siblings, uncles/aunts and family friends are the most frequent perpetrators. ""Stranger Danger"" is a myth.

4. ""Grooming"" is a term that refers to an older child or adult attempting to integrate themselves into a potential victim's life to facilitate an abusive scenario. It manifests as gift-giving, special favors, frequent unwanted touching, and continuous attempts to gain access to a specific child above and beyond what would normally be accepted. It does NOT refer to general gestures of friendliness towards a child or non-sexual, non-intimate physical contact UNLESS that contact is constant and causes the child distress.

5. Secrecy is an enormous component of what allows these acts to go unreported. Pedophiles always seek to isolate their targets both physically and emotionally from their families and peers.


The solution, in my mind, is for both parents and educators to teach children in kindergarten the three R's:

1. **Recognize** that no one can touch where their bathing suit covers.

2. **Resist** anyone trying to touch them in that area. If it’s an adult or an older child: run, kick, scream. If it’s someone their age: call for an adult immediately.

3. **Report** to a parent or teacher anything upsetting that they did, or were asked to do, with the absolute assurance that they will not face any negative consequences for sharing. They must be aware that this applies even if they promised to keep it “secret.”



In addition, children should be taught that it's always okay to kindly ask someone to stop touching them if they aren't comfortable with the touch. This empowers children by recognizing their ability to consent to touch they enjoy while rejecting touch that makes them uncomfortable.



Equally important to combating this problem is emphasizing what sort of contact ISN'T a danger to children, and merely distracts us from the true threats. Just as we must enforce that the ""bad touches"" need to be reported and punished, we must also protect the legitimacy of ""good touches."" A parent kissing their child on the lips should never be the cause of controversy, as it was in June's David Beckham fiasco. Nor should we allow male childcare workers to be profiled and attacked by parents and coworkers for consensual contact that isn't sexually explicit (hugs, tickles and touches outside of the bathing suit area, etc).



Gentle, silly, affectionate and nurturing physical contact between children and the adults around them is a very important part of their social and emotional development, and viewing them with reckless suspicion benefits no one. Even if parents are uncomfortable with their children talking with strangers at the park, or engaging in consensual horseplay with a male teacher, they must recognize that these are minor personal issues with their own comfort and not actual threats to their child's safety.



With these concrete guidelines, the tactics abusers rely on will be far less reliable thanks to an informed child population and adults who 
evaluate actual threats more effectively.

If you want evidence of this just be a fly on the wall at any staff meeting in any school.

The meeting will be lead by Gary, the deputy head. This is because the head teacher is at a meeting with other head teachers discussing how to make the most of staff meetings. 

Gary is very pleased with his title and has a sign saying deputy head outside his office where he hides from the children who now scare him. He spends his days working on next year’s timetable and creating important sounding strategic documents that are slowly eating away at his soul. 

3.30pm. The staff meeting begins with Gary trying to plug his laptop into the projector. He has no idea how to do this so the IT technician Martin is called. Martin has too many of the students as friends on facebook. He spends 5 minutes unplugging things and eventually connects the projector but it is projecting upside down. Whilst this is going on Gary passes around 6000 printouts about differentiation that he found on the internet at lunchtime and has not read. Martin stands on a chair and changes the aspect ratio, for no apparent reason, before deciding that the projector can function well enough for the meeting to begin. 

3.40pm The projector shows a PowerPoint with the title ‘Observation Schedule 2017. Focus: Differentiation and EAL’. At least four of the teachers in the room don’t know what EAL stands for. Beneath the title is a photo of some of the students in a classroom, one is black, one is white and one is Sikh. The black kid and the Sikh kid hate that they are in every bit of promotional material for the school. This is the only slide that will be projected today. There was no need for the projector. 

3.45pm The door flies open and Mrs Pinkney the art teacher shuffles in carrying a bag the size of Italy. She mutters under her breath that she hasn’t got fucking time for this because coursework is due on Friday and Meghan and Robbie haven’t even started. Meghan and Robbie are smart and know that by leaving their art coursework until the last minute they can get Mrs Pinkney to do it for them. As Mrs Pinkney sits down she spills her coffee over Helen. Helen is taking minutes of the meeting even though no one has ever read any of the minutes of any of the meetings. She is the head teacher’s PA. She is the most intelligent person in the room, has the patience of a saint and most of the teaching staff treat her like shit. 

3.50pm Gary has asked for teachers to put themselves forward for a working party to improve differentiation in the school. Miss Gregory, a young English teacher in her first year of teaching puts herself forward because she is adorably naïve and thinks there is a point to these things. Mr Brown the history teacher also offers to join the working party because he hopes to put his hands on Miss Gregory’s boobies one day. Mr Brown ‘moved on’ from his last school because he patted one too many teaching assistants on the bottom.

4.00pm Mr Horton, a bearded science teacher who has just woken up from his nap decides it’s time for his favourite topic and so announces ‘I don’t think students or staff should have to wear ties’ Teachers spend the next twenty minutes taking turns to put forward their unsolicited opinions. A PE teacher tries to join in with the discussion but is quickly shut down by the group because he’s not a real teacher. 

4.20pm Ten minutes before the end of the meeting the second point on the 10 point agenda is brought up: Reports. The most important thing that needs to be established with report writing is whether or not subjects should have capital letters. This is debated and a vote is held. It is agreed that only English and other languages are allowed capital letters. Ms. Finch the geography teacher (who was off sick yesterday buying a fridge) says ‘I’m going to give geography a capital G and if you want to change it that’s up to you ’ Helen, the head teacher’s PA will spend several hours next week changing capital Gs to lower case gs. 

4.30 The meeting ends. Gary thanks everyone for their hard work saying this is the strongest staff he has ever worked with. Everyone leaves thinking that this was yet another colossal waste of time entirely unaware that they are the reason it was a colossal waste of time. 

Individually, teachers are devoted, nurturing, inspiring and entertaining. Collectively they are morons.

She speaks and reads English well, but needs just a little extra time to process and respond than her native-speaking peers. She is enrolled in AP Biology this year and is doing very well so far, but I'm beginning to see the impact of the language barrier on her performance on quizzes. 

To prepare students for the AP Exam in May, I've timed my quizzes so they get about the same amount of time per question that they should budget for the real deal. This works out to about 75 seconds per multiple choice question, and variable amounts of time for short answer questions. We've only had three quizzes so far, and students are finally beginning to feel the time crunch - I had to physically remove answer sheets from a couple of them yesterday. About a third of the class did not finish the quiz - most left the last question blank.

The exchange student, however, definitely did not have time to adequately answer the last *four* questions - based on the answers she chose, I think she randomly picked answers for three, and left the last blank. She seemed upset when I finally took her paper.

We already worked out an arrangement where she gets an extension on longer writing assignments (like lab reports and essays), and that has worked out well so far. However, we had not discussed extra time on quizzes and tests. The College Board doesn't appear to accommodate ELL students by giving them extra time on AP exams, so I feel like I'd be doing her a disservice by giving her extra time now, only to take it away in May. At the same time, I don't want to discourage her by preventing her from demonstrating her full understanding of the material on these assessments.

I just started a position as an Assistant Teacher at a pretty successful but also very controversial charter school, and I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it to the end of my year. I was in training all last week and have been in the classroom this week, but I can't tell if the reasons I'm ready to cut and run are things that will get better with time or things that I'm being unreasonable about or if I'm just not cut out for teaching like I thought I was. It's a combination of how the administration has handled things with me, but also how I see the students being treated. 


Things that have happened:


I have been chastised for helping a student rather than disciplining them.


I have been given duties that I literally cannot fulfill (taking attendance when I haven't been given access to the attendance webpage, then chastised for not taking attendance). When I have tried to ask for help in gaining access, I have been brushed off to six or seven different people, then been given workarounds that do not fix the problem long-term.


The students aren't allowed to talk during lunch and, because the playground is currently under construction, they spend their recess in their rooms either doing extra work or practicing lining up silently. They're then disciplined for having too much energy in the afternoon when they have been given no way to play or run any of that energy off. 


I have advisees who I am supposed to build relationships with, but am given no time during the day to actually interact with them. 


My first few days in the school I was not given a break to eat or go to the bathroom. I've also been working close to 12-hour days with an hour commute each way, which I'm finding incredibly tiring and unsustainable. 


The teaching method here prizes efficiency over everything else, but often doesn't give students a chance to think or process what is going on, before moving on to the next point or topic.


I guess overall, it just feels very drill-sergeant-esque, and I'm not sure it meshes with my vision for what teaching should be. Obviously there should be discipline, boundaries, and expectations that the students need to meet, but I also feel like there should be room for joy and fun. I've seen very little joy and fun in my first week. By maybe I'm just naive. 


I'm also wrestling with crippling guilt at the thought of leaving, like I'll be letting myself and the students down. I've never quit anything after two weeks in my life, and it just feels like a huge failure as this is my first ""real"" job after graduate school. 


I know this school has a huge turnover rate, so me leaving wouldn't be unheard of, but I just feel so guilty. I feel like I'm failing. I don't really know if I wrote this just to get my thoughts down, or to get advice from other teachers but... any thoughts or advice would be appreciated. Maybe I just need a reality check.

I have a bachelors in Business Admin, but this semester enrolled in a Masters Program for Childhood Education (1-6).

I am considering changing my focus to History, and working in a Middle School or High School. I am really trying to find the pros and cons of both. Each seem to be great in their own way. I'm kind of a History nerd and do truly enjoy the subject. Although, basic education in elementary seems quite simple and straightforward. This is a big career change for me and I know I want to become an instructor, I just want to find my place.

I guess what I am deeply wondering is: 

* the current job outlook for these positions (are they in demand?)

* pay grades (is there a difference subject to subject, or grade to grade?)

* quality of life (typical elementary school day vs typical MS/HS school day?)

On my current track, after student teaching and all, I should be ready to have a class by January 2020 (school PT), but assuming it would begin Fall 2020 (new school year), unless I take over through a Leave of Absence or something.

I graduated last May with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry. When i graduated, I took a year long contract position doing research.

Fast forward a year, and I just got a new job working in industry, and hate it just as much, if not more than research.

My concern is, I dont know how to get into the industry ( Im in MA, btw). All the post-bac programs require field studies, which means theres no way I could hold a full time job and do that. I still have bills I need to pay. and student loans to pay off.

Asking for some advice. Today I was teaching about slavery, an already sensitive subject, and showed a TED-Ed video about the Atlantic slave trade. The para in my class (who is black) asked me if the video would discuss Africans selling Africans. I said yes, and he said it was “some bullshit” and that Africans didn’t sell Africans and left the room. 

As a social studies teacher that tries to be culturally responsive and give kids the most accurate information possible, I was taken aback by his comment. This is the first time in my career I’ve been accused of being racist. I later came to find he was taking about the video to another para. I feel like I was teaching kids the truth and I don’t understand where he is coming from as multiple sources verify the fact that Africans did in fact sell other Africans. I also didn’t only teach that slavery was started because Africans sold other Africans, the rest of the video discussed how white people were the most responsible for all the ills of slavery.

[x-post from r/NewJersey],"Warning, this may be long and have a few points that are less than necessary, but here goes:

I've been kind of just humming along in my professional life since I've had one.  I got a BA in Communications almost 10 years ago that I've put to poor use working in a non-related job in the private sector.  A friend recently started working at a middle school.  He's not a teacher, but told me that there are a large portion of younger teachers of varying backgrounds who went alternate route.  Back when I was in school, teaching was a profession I strongly considered.  I had considered the possibility of going through a Master's program at my school (I was very close to completing my Bachelor's at this point) in order to teach.  I mostly wanted it for the wrong reasons (no drug testing, summers off), and I was basically a constantly anxious, antisocial hermit at the time.  For those reasons above, as well as sheer laziness, I decided against the Master's program and entered the private sector.

10 years later, my anxiety is still not great, but it's much better.  Professionally, I'm in a corporate M-F 9-5 job that isn't too bad, pays decent, but just isn't fulfilling.  Upward mobility exists, but I'm not sure if climbing the corporate ladder is something I'm cut out for or would be interested in doing.  I've been looking for something to put me on a more solid path for awhile, but nothing past cursory glances at this or that.  When my friend mentioned the alternate route, I have been thinking more and more about it.  I'm a different person than I was 10 years ago, and the world has changed so much in that time, also.  I've always thought that teaching was one of a handful of jobs that really matter, and with today's political/intellectual climate, the idea of molding future minds really humbles, scares, and excites me.  It feels like a lot of work, but maybe could ultimately be something that gives my life the purpose it's been missing.

Anyway, I started actually looking into this today.  I'm interested in [doing this](http://www.state.nj.us/education/educators/license/endorsements/1103CEAS.pdf)*.  I found [this old thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/5b40ze/alternate_route_teaching/), which had a couple interesting/helpful comments.  What I'm looking to get from this thread is basically anything you might think would be helpful.  If you're currently teaching and went alternate route, please share your experience.  I'd love to hear what brought you to your decision, what you went through, what your reservations were, how you overcame them, and ultimately, if you feel like it was worth it to you.  Of course, practical advice is absolutely always welcome, but I'm just interested to hear from people who have done it and what they have to say.  Thanks in advance for all your help, fellow New Jerseyans!

Advice?,"My wife works in a difficult urban high school that has been designated by the district as  problematic, teetering on the edge of drastic action, like shutting it down. After just a few months there, she's having a really hard time with it. 

Students call her ""bitch"", ugly, crazy, etc. on a daily basis. They have thrown objects at her (including staples clips) and stepped on her feet on purpose. They tell her ""I don't give a fuck"" about her class. They cheat. They rip up their tests. Rap or dance or fight in class. She has to call the office to get someone into the room to break up the chaos on an almost daily basis. They use their cell phones, including playing multiplayer sports games with each other (and shouting at the top of their voice when they score), and talk loudly constantly, etc. She is getting vocal strain issues: now clears her throat all day, even when she comes home because she has to try to talk over the constant clamor. There are some good and respectful students, but not enough to compensate for the disruptive ones.

She is also often officially observed while teaching, and that always makes her feel super self-conscious and hurts her pride and self-esteem so much, because she feels they will judge her as incompetent. I tell her that's nonsense, that she's working with such a difficult group of 14-19 year olds, but she can't believe me. She even had a fairly good evaluation recently, but still tenses up so much for each new official observation.

Mon--Fri she is kind of like a grey, poison-filled zombie when I see her at home after work. By about Saturday at noon on 3 out of 4 weeks the color comes back to her face and I get my old wife back. This is the week where it lasts the weekend. 

Because of previous experience and degrees, her salary is very good and better than what she has made before. It is helping us in our retirement plans greatly after many years of just being unwise about our financial planning, and giving us future options that likely could greatly help us enjoy our 50s and beyond. Each 180 day school year is a major accelerator for that. But she is saying she can't do this more. I get that. I am going to help her look for better schools in the area as a possibility, but that's mostly up to chance and she may very well not get anything else. I think, realistically, anything else she could work at (non K-12 teacher) would be a massive drop in salary.

Is this hopeless? Is there a way she can get through another Sep--June school year intact? I don't think I can sign on to any more than one more 180 day year for her in *this* school, but I'm wondering if even that is asking too much of her. I know *other* people could not take the students' verbal abuse so personally, not care how observers rate her, etc.--and instead focus on the good salary and 3 months off a year--but with her personality it really seems to be a losing battle.

Advice? Thank you!

I have a bit of a problem and I'd like some help/outside opinions/thoughts on something I've been reflecting on for the past couple days.

I'm student teaching an AP Lit class at a public option school (for the arts), which means it's on the smaller side and every senior has to take this class in order to graduate, so I've had a chance to work closely with all the seniors. 

Last week, the seniors had a meeting where they got to vote in a student speaker and a teacher speaker to speak at graduation this year. I was told by the students that I was relatively unanimously chosen to be their speaker, and that's super flattering! However, it's come with a few problems. For one, I have no idea how I'm supposed to live up to the expectations of my students. It's nice that they believe in me, or like me, or whatever, but I've never needed to do something so formal and anticipated before. I'm not really one for tradition, so it's pretty intimidating on deciding what to do.

On top of that, I've heard murmurs around the school that some staff members and administrators are upset that the students chose me instead of a full time teacher at the school. I understand and agree with the frustration that I, essentially the flavor of the month, take a huge opportunity from somebody who deserves it more. I have no doubt that there'd be hard feelings going around regardless of who was chosen, but as a result I'm feeling extra pressure to impress my peers so I can validate the decision our students made. 

Lastly, I don't even know if I have what it takes to pass edTPA and earn my license. If I can't pass that, then what business do I have speaking at that point? I'm not even a teacher, just a dude who failed a grad program. It's validating that my students believe in me, but I just can't make sense of what I did to deserve this treatment. This whole year it feels like I've been Alice wandering around wonderland. I haven't had a single disciplinary issue, students are receptive to being challenged, and I have an incredible relationship with my CT. Out of all the people in my program it feels like I deserve this bounty the least and I can't help but feel guilty. There are people who are studying to become high school teachers but get placed at a difficult middle school, or people are having issues with loans and that's getting thrown into the mix with all the other shit we have to do.  Don't get me wrong, I'm super happy with teaching and where I'm at, but it feels like the people who work harder than I do should get this and I want to improve myself to make good on the station I'm currently at, but I don't feel like I'm good enough yet and I don't really have faith that I'll reach that point soon.

So I guess what I'm asking is, how do you deal with handling your public perception as a teacher? What do you even say during a graduation speech as a teacher? If your students are playing you as a 'favorite' over other teachers how are you supposed to react?

To cap it all off, the public option school attracts quite a few teachers with a lot of professional experience in their artform, so I'm basically this dinky 22 year old child soaking up attention because I'm new, but I don't really have anything to offer them that the other teachers can.

Tl:Dr: Chosen to speak at graduation by senior class, but having trouble designing something that will appease the expectations of students, teachers, and administrators. Also struggling with my own views of self-worth vs. the feedback I get from other people. Looking for thoughts, opinions, feedback, advice, anything.

Thanks for your time! Hope you have a good day.

Wrangling 15+ 7-year-olds into following boring programming instructions with no help from my coworker? Exhausting.

And near the end we got a child whose scabs were still healing from the physically abusive situation he had just gotten out of, who usually has an aide in school (we did not get an aide) - as terribly as I feel for the kid, the experience was honestly kind of horrible for me. I hope to one day be the kind of person that could handle that but I'm not there yet. Monday was a holiday that week and it was still the longest week of my life.

Worst of all was the battle with myself - they have fun when I'm having fun, and I can't reliably make myself have fun. And trying to stay empathetic and compassionate with the problem kids was hard and I know I started slipping near the end.

I also caught myself thinking, after I overheard a minor altercation on the playground, ""that can be [coworker]'s problem"" once near the end of the summer.

Last year also I noticed a trend where, though I had more experience than the other two employees, I would be assigned to 'artsy' classes, classes with younger kids, or, if assigned to a programming class, I would be ""support"" to one of my male coworkers. It happened often enough that it's hard for me to chalk it up to coincidence or my own insecurity, especially since I really do have more experience than either of the others. Then again, I can think of reasonable things that would explain the separate incidents. Whatever. Anyway my problem is that this is not something I would bring up with her - not worth it, especially since I doubt she even realizes she's doing it - but it still bugs me and is a slight part of the reason I'm hesitant to return this year.

-----

So in summation I'm trying to figure out how to bring up these points with her:

- smaller class sizes, especially if they're young
- have appropriate support for students with needs
- two weeks on, one week off? To help prevent the burnout I experienced last year (it was really bad near the end)
- Also, need August partially off for a trip

...without being too demanding or sensitive.

She's been a big influence in my life and has apparently been in my corner looking for career opportunities for me...I'm just scared that if I go into this again this year without saying anything I'll end up messed up again. Last summer had a lot of great moments and I discovered that I really love teaching but it was not a net positive for me. 

I know I'm a good teacher though, I had so much fun with the kids and several parents told my boss about how much their kids loved having me, and seeing them really GET something I was teaching was so amazing. Teaching is not something I'd pursue as a career (I'm not tough enough) but it is something I want to keep doing. I just need to figure out how to make it work for me without annoying anybody.

Annnd it's also my best bet for solid employment for the summer...

So I am finishing up my student teaching and starting to apply to some jobs. I'm having a hard time trying to figure out what to put on my resume..

for my student teaching, I've had a difficult time for a few reasons

-I'm in a very poor Title I area where parents dont give AF, students have issues, and most students are below grade level.

-We had a student who was just now diagnosed with EBD, so hes just now getting meds and services. He was violent in the classroom, threatening kids and myself, throwing things at kids, breaking stuff, etc. 

-Because of that, my principal watched me teach all day every day for a month

-I'm in a 1/2 split, so I plan for 2 grades and 2 standards on top of 40% of my students being ELL and 60% of them below grade level. (I have 2nd graders at a kindergarten level)

-I have my emergency sub cert so I get pulled all the time to sub in other classrooms 

-They've decided to add a science curriculum to my reading time. At the same time, my mentor teacher is going to start teaching a low group of readers from another class. I'll be doing the pilot of integrating our science curriculum into our reading. I'll be doing it by myself, with no assistance, and no teacher in the room to help me. I found out Friday after school and I start doing this next Monday... and we don't have school this week. 

How much of this do I include in my resume? and for the stuff I do include, how do I phrase it professionally?

I'd been debating all of this year whether to leave the profession or not, because frankly, it's gotten to the point where the low pay, the workload, bureaucracy, and the sometimes ridiculous expectations have become too much. I made it official yesterday by writing a letter of resignation to my principal (I'll be leaving after the year ends)

Honestly, I feel a lot better after doing it, knowing that I'll be done with teaching in just over three months. I've never felt as drained as I have this year, and I felt like no matter what I did I was always behind on work. What's funny is that work is the only part of my life that hasn't gone right: I've gotten myself into the best shape I've ever been in, I'm doing well with finances, I'm regularly reading and writing, and over the last few weeks I've been improving my productivity habits too. I genuinely feel like I'm making strides in all parts of my life EXCEPT my career

And it sucks that it's come to this, because I've absolutely enjoyed all of my students (not just this year, but past years too). One of the second grade girls here is absolutely in love with me and has been telling me all year that she wants to be in my class next year (her mom even said she's going to make sure her daughter is in my class). The students have been the least of my worries in teaching, and I've been at some rough schools (not this year though). If my students and their families weren't as great as they were I probably would have quit way earlier in the year

This is the right thing to do though, for my sanity more than anything. What's the next step? Not 100% sure yet. I'll still get paid and have my benefits over the summer, so at least I have that cushion, but once August ends I'll need to find something else. I do have another degree in communication, so I'm sure between my skills in that and skills from teaching I can find something

My spirits have been raised a little bit, knowing that the end is around the corner (it'll all be downhill after spring break). It's a shame, I know I'm not the only person to leave teaching due to reasons like this. I can't speak for other states, but I have a hunch this is partially why Illinois has a teacher shortage. Hopefully our education system can start making the big changes it needs to, otherwise it's only going to get worse

Edit: forgot to mention, I definitely won't be missing the pettiness and passive aggressiveness that, bizarrely, plagues so many teachers. One of the other third grade teachers knows I'll be leaving and has already started treating me indifferently 

Second edit: I'm not saying whatever new job I find is going to be perfect and problem-free, but it's hard to think of many jobs that demand so much of you and give back so little the way teaching does",,7yyhh8,,0,,false,1520570571,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7yyhh8/officially_handed_in_my_resignation_yesterday/,,,,,

(Python course),"I’m teaching a programming “fundamentals” course in Python. This is in quotes for reasons I’ll go into later. Curriculum requirements are 

-	Conditionals
-	Loops
-	Functions
-	Data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries

At the end of the course, students should be able to write a terminal game and solve beginner coding problems. They should feel comfortable enough to continue furthering their studies independently.

Long story short, my course used to be 8 weeks and now its 4 weeks so lol

Currently our curriculum feels really hand-holdy, so imo, I don’t think students are really learning anything. I think that’s why students are struggling (besides the fact that the course is way too short). It seems that most students think programming is magical, and it’s because the curriculum never teaches them how mechanical programming actually is.

I just gained more control over the curriculum. This is what I want to do:

Instead of teaching Python, the language, I want to teach concepts that are language agnostic. I’ve been wanting to move the course towards being more about understanding what exactly is happening in each line of code.

I started really understanding code through struggle. I learned all of the “fundamentals” on my own. 

I have a couple ideas on how to do this, but sometimes I lose faith that it will work because a lot of my students are having problems understanding that, for example, functions aren’t magic. 

I also don’t know if this is the best approach for a 4 week course. Maybe it should be magic, and they can just figure the rest out on their own?

He has formed a great relationship with my teacher and has little to no problems. With me, however, it's a different story and it's not only affecting him at school but also at home. Together we've decided on already having him start to meet his first grade teacher, and everyone agrees that in the long run this transition is good for him, but I still feel awful and incompetent.

Some times he won't do the work and will just shut down. We've been working on using computer time as a reward, and that sometimes works. But his volume level has increased, his emotional instability has increased, and altogether it's a constant struggle. Last week, he had a melt down because my mentor had to switch him off the computer. He came back to the classroom and laid on the floor and never having seen it before, I told him to either pick a chair or the couch in the corner to calm himself down. He went to the couch and started screaming. All the classrooms heard and I had him doing a full meltdown for ten minutes with two aides and myself coming in to try and help unsuccessfully. I know now that I should'v just left him on the floor, but that just was the turning point for behavior. 

How can I help this student? Sometimes he won't listen, and I can't constantly redirect him. Other times he's too loud, but I'd rather have him loud and participating than quiet and doing no work. It's such a hard balancing act. I'm full-time teaching for 3 more weeks and I'm not honestly sure I can handle this for that long. Sometimes on carpet he'll just get up and flop around, and if I move him, he'll spin on the chair, and if it's the desk, he's not listening. It's such a hard transition for it, and I feel so bad that it's affecting him so much. Him sitting next to me helps too, but only for a really minimal amount of time. My mentor has decided I need to be more firm with setting boundaries and not allowing those choices, but I've tried that too and then he melts down then. Today he walked out of my class. Help!

What can I do so that both he and I survive these next few weeks? Please help, I'm desperate. I also need to start recording lessons soon and, as bad as this sounds, I want to have this somewhat figured out before that time comes.

This is my third year teaching elementary art and my first at a title 1 school (taught my first two at an “A” school in a good part of town, but moved). When I got hired at my current school I was given the impression that the administration was no nonsense and that they had the teacher’s backs. The principle has been here for 10+ years and seemed like a very authoritative figure.
What I have learned though is she is a bully and does not follow through on her word and caters to every parent’s complaint.

Now, onto the issue at hand. I have many students with IEPs, behavioral issues, etc. Last Friday I had a 3rd grade student get upset because I asked him to pick up beads that he had spilt. Before I could talk him through this he bolts out the door yelling that we (his class and myself) are a bunch of assholes. I then stand in the door way watching him run while also trying to watch the class. Had to have another student stand at the door and watch the runner as I called the front office for assistance. 
While waiting for assistance the runner starts walking back to my class calling me every curse word he can think of. I ask him politely to please come back inside and he tells me to “fuck off” before slamming the door in my face. I try to open the door back up (so I can keep an eye on him) and he’s pushing it back and then slams it on the side of my face. At that point one of the secretaries has come to get him because our principal, vice principle, and guidance counselor were all out that day. 

Here are my concerns. 
The student in question has yet to be punished. 
I talked with the vice principal on Monday morning (she’s in charge of discipline) and she had no idea it happened and had no idea the principal was not here on Friday. She told me she would get to the bottom of everything and get back with me. Later that after noon the VP told me that the Principal was here Friday when it happened and she would take care of it (talk to the student’s parents). 

Cut to today absolutely nothing has been done and no one has talked to me about the incident. I was not hurt, but I feel like cursing and slamming the door on my head warrants some kind of reprimand?? I’ve spoke to my team leader and she said that his family is notoriously difficult, their child does no wrong in their eyes, and he has an IEP so nothing will probably get done.

What do I do??? Am I suppose to just let it go? Accept that this is how it’s always going to be or do I talk with the principal and hold her accountable? 

If I’ve left out any important information let me know. I’m just so frustrated with this situation.

I have wanted to teach elementary school for most of my life. I just love interacting with kids and the idea of helping them learn socially/academically and hopefully inspiring them to lead kind and impactful lives. That’s the dream at least; My mom is a teacher so I know some days are more about just surviving than changing the world, but every job has good and bad days. To summarize a long story, I messed up in high school and chose a college major for the sole purpose of making money.

During my sophomore year (2 years ago), I rediscovered my desire to be a teacher, much to the chagrin of my family. I met with an adviser in the education department about changing majors, but because of the course sequence/prerequisite requirements, I would have had to add two more years of undergraduate coursework, essentially making me a freshman all over again. I opted to just finish what I started, and tackle the issue in a few years with an engineering degree in hand. 

I have now reached that point, and I have another decision to make. Until recently, I have been full-steam ahead interviewing for full-time positions in order to please my family, with most of them in engineering or management. I even got really excited about one of those companies. However, what I really want to do is to get an MAT, which is a Masters in Teaching (a 1-year, ~40 credit certification program for people who want to be teachers but have a bachelor’s degree in a different field.) I know there are other ways to get into teaching and get certified without paying for a year of grad school, but I want to do this because I want to do right by the kids. I want to know what I’m doing to as great an extent as possible so that I can be a great teacher.

So, I guess I am just looking for advice. What would you do in my situation?  As far as jobs I can work in the meantime, Is subbing/working at summer camp good experience for future teachers? Have any of you been in similar situations? Was it worth giving up the financial stability of another type of job? Would the student debt from a year of grad school be crippling on a teacher’s salary? Any advice or comments at all are appreciated. 

I am a male (I feel that bears mentioning due to the disproportionately low number of males in elementary ed.), and my MBTI type is ISFP.

Left the classroom after 4 years to pursue policy masters...now thinking about returning to classroom?,"First, this community has offered so much support to me in the past and I'm grateful for the space to gain such perspective (and sometimes, comic relief). I could really use some external advice on this dilemma and appreciate any time you could give.

Here's my situation: I began teaching with TFA (I know, I know...) at a small charter and later went to a public school with an identical make up. After a total of 4 year in the classroom teaching special ed, first grade, and second grade--I was feeling like an effective teacher, but also like a pretty burnt out teacher. I generally operate under the ""be weary of blaming external sources for what's going wrong"" attitude when it comes to teaching, but ineffective district policy, inconsistent and volatile school leadership, and general lack of support really started to hamper my confidence as an educator.

I applied and was accepted to a good public policy school, thinking that educational change could best be affected by supporting school communities from the outside. I have a year to go for my masters and am just finishing up an internship at a education nonprofit whose mission and work I really believe in--but I keep circling back to the question: are (most) education nonprofits cluttering up the education landscape? Are these opt-in supports even helping the districts who need it most? Other less important factors are: I don't like sitting at a desk for most of the day, it turns out I like working with kids/young adults more than actual adults, and enjoy having a direct and measurable impact on a school and community engagement.

Is it acceptable/worthwhile to transition to secondary education post-masters, and use my policy degree to make some baller Social Studies or English lessons? Maybe try for school leadership, once I feel truly confident in how middle/high schools work and what supports teachers *need* to feel confident? This begs the question--why did I take on loans and an extra degree just to do something I could've done without it?

OR, do I give other nonprofit/outside policy work a fair shake--and look more toward wraparound services or even in-district support positions?  

Tl;dr: Taught in elementary schools for 4 years, left to pursue loosely-related public policy masters degree, now trying to decide between the nonprofit sphere or returning to a new role in the classroom.

I know a few of my classmates that have graduated and gotten job offers in Illinois (mainly CPS). I do not want to stay in Illinois, I hope to relocate (preferably out west). 

Also, I realize a lot of other factors will play into demand (a state may have jobs but that could easily be because of a bad state education system, etc). I browse school district job boards fairly often to see open history/social studies jobs. So far, I see that Texas cities have a decent amount of openings. Maybe the state's politics are not welcoming to teachers? (But please, let's put politics aside!)

Are there any other areas that have social studies/history jobs? Preferably suburbs of cities or cities themselves and public schools. I do speak Spanish.

This project was inspired by a random teacher in Texas last year who selected my school from a list of Washington state school, and then sent a letter to my school marked ""2nd grade teacher"".  My students LOVED filling out the survey together, and it sparked a nice conversation on the differences between our two parts of the country.

I know this doesn't apply to all teachers, but I believe that a grading scale that moves 0 points to 50% encourages students to try and not be afraid of failing if they get wrong answers on homework. I only use this for homework, as this is when students *should* be making mistakes and learning from them. *

When it comes time to grade them, it's a bit of a hassle as the grading software doesn't automatically use this special system. 
_______________________________________
Here's how I made it work: 

- First, to calculate the percentage on a 50 point scale, divide by the points possible, multiply that result by 50, then and add 50 to that result. 

**Ex. On a 25 point assignment a student earned 22 points. 22/25 = 0.88 (88% would be the standard percentage). 0.88 x 50 + 50 = 94 (the new percentage).** 

- When I create the assignment in my online gradebook, I assign the points possible as normal, but I need to figure out how many points are needed to get the modified percentage. 


- Next, I open up a spreadsheet on Excel or Google Sheets. There is a proportional relationship between the modified percentage and the points needed for that percent. We're gonna use a function to calculate the new point value to enter into the gradebook. 

- I use three cells. The first one is for the raw score entry. The second cell uses this raw score and the algorithm above to give the modified percentage 

**Ex. [Cell2] = ([Cell1] / 25 * 50 + 50)  ===&gt; [Cell2] = 94**

- The third cell then calculates the points to be entered into the gradebook by using the proportional relationship. 


**Ex. [Cell3] = ([Cell2]/100 * 25) ===&gt; [Cell3] = 23.5**


This is the score I enter into the gradebook to display the correct percentage and grade. 

______________________________________________

*Missing assignments are still entered in as a 0 since there's no evidence of even trying and making mistakes. 


If any other teachers out there have been struggling to implement a 50 percent grading scale, I hope this helped a bit! Just sharing my experiences so far.

Reading teacher: Title I school, 30+ kids per class, unsupportive administration","I hope this doesn't turn into too much of a jumbled rant, though I apologize if it does. I didn't start this with a direction that I wanted to go in: I mainly just wanted to get some stuff off my chest to fellow teachers who may understand.

Teaching makes me feel bipolar sometimes. My situation doesn't help. 

When I come home, I'm excessively proud of my students...While constantly being disappointed by them, as well. There's a lot of apathy, belligerence, and self-destruction...But I also command decent respect. I haven't been cussed at yet, and my students generally apologize for their poor behavior. 

I'm frustrated with administration, but I also understand how overloaded they are. Our school is drowning and the county can't afford buckets, never mind repairs for our half-sunken ship.

I have some days that I go in thinking, ""We need to deal with X problem swiftly and with decent force because it really can't escalate."" Other days, I spend time reminding myself that many of my students come from really bad situations–several are homeless–and that I also have to be patient, but stern.

Adding onto the excrement-squall: I was never paired with a mentor, and, even though this is my ""second"" year, I'm still yet to receive training that isn't in the form of outdated computer modules thrown together in the early 90's. I didn't major in education, so I've been going into this ""fairly"" blindly. There's no collaborative planning, no in-service...And I've met our department head once.

Last year, my first year, I took over after school had started and administration gave me semi-decent support. By the time I had accepted the position, 6 teachers had already quit and 2 had been fired who initially taught the class...Which is most likely why they ""laid on"" the compliments. This year, it's been nothing but criticism. Nothing but negative feedback.

The teacher who has been my makeshift mentor has been teaching for 38 years. She was formerly a principal, taught nearly every subject, opened her own school, and was a reading coach for a few years. This is her first year teaching intensive reading (ESOL last year), taking it over because she was assigned it. 

She's a great source of knowledge, but has been incredibly negative this year due to a lot of personal problems on top of being thrown into a class she didn't want to teach in the first place. Although she's the best thing I could ask for as a mentor (I've had a lot of fellow teachers I don't even know approach me and tell me how fortunate I have become close with her), this year I've become *her* support system to keep her going. Whereas last year, she was what grounded me and kept me going, this year, I'm the one staying positive. 

Like I said, I don't even know where I'm going with it. Just needed a moment to vent and let it all out. I have days that I step back and say, ""Wow, I'm doing a really good job"", and others where I feel like I can't do anything right. 

I suppose that's the norm as a teacher. I live and learn as best as I can. Compared to last year, though, my confidence is wavering. I don't come home as sure of myself and my ability to do this job. Last year was far worse (I had a student assault me in my first few days), but despite how calm this year is, I'm finding myself in a place that I don't want to accept. It's like I love this job and am already finding myself questioning it in a non-superficial sense. 

At the same time, I wonder how much of my morale last year was is due to the rare, but occasional supportive sentiment administration passed my way. Or how much of it was because my pseudo-mentor was a light of positivity.",,72nu8w,,0,,false,1507603310,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/72nu8w/int_reading_teacher_title_i_school_30_kids_per/,,,,,

I thought it might also be helpful to write a list of tips for regular teachers for when they need substitutes. 

All of these involve issues that I run into frequently, unfortunately, hence the decision to make a list.

I hope it's helpful!

## Making the job posting

*Assign the correct job type*

Depending on which system your district uses, this process will vary, but the systems that my two districts use both have a way of putting in the job type. IE, science, ELA, chemistry, etc etc.

This is very important to put in as accurately as possible! These systems only let you put in one job type, so put in the one that requires the most expertise. (IE, science and ELA both, put in science, since anyone with a university degree ought to be able to handle English)

This is for two reasons. One, if a substitute shows up and finds themselves with a different assignment than expected, you're probably going to have an annoyed sub that day - and one that isn't suited to the job, to boot. Two, the system prioritizes jobs based on the job type, and sometimes it runs out of certain kinds of substitutes. By mislabeling the job, it can make another teacher have a worse match for a substitute, too.

*Add parking instructions in the assignment posting notes*

Not in the lesson plan itself! By then it's too late. Even if your school has really easy parking, with loads of spots for visitors, it still takes an aspect of stress off the sub's shoulders to know, ahead of time, what the parking situation is like.

*Mention grades taught in assignment notes, if applicable*

If your school is a regular high school, then the sub already knows what possible ages s/he's teaching. If your school is a k-12 school,  however, then this information is *extremely useful.* Subs will have preferred ages to work with, and having more time to psych themselves up if they find themselves with an age range they have a hard time with can be helpful.

## Classroom Prep

*Have a dedicated substitute binder*

While this isn't exactly mandatory, this is so helpful. You can just slide your lesson plan into this, as well as whatever material you need for the day (like worksheets). Further, you can have the first section include general, useful information for the substitute, that will apply to all classes.

Useful things to include are:

* Emergency procedure information
* Important extensions (such as the office)
* Cell phone and bathroom policy
* Any weird stuff your school does (like a study block instead of a class block in the afternoon, which is fairly common in high schools here, but they all have worked differently. IE, some need attendance taken, and others don't.)
* How announcements are handled (sometimes over the PA system, sometimes the teachers grab a paper from the office, sometimes it's a website teachers must go to, etc)
* Basic discipline policy
* Preference on notes from the sub (brief, overall note for the whole day, to detailed notes on each class. E-mail, or written and left on the desk, etc.)
* Bell schedule (also, please note if there's not a bell schedule at all! Some schools don't use bells for beginning and end of class, and that's thrown me off on a few occasions.)
* Printed map of the school. (Bonus points if you mark where food can be found, like vending machines)

These can be made ahead of time and can remain the same over the course of years.

Sometimes, more specific details for these classes can be helpful to add, too.

Examples include things like making note of a transgender student, so the substitute can use the preferred pronoun. Making note of particularly helpful students that can be trusted to be truthful about things like school policies, or problematic students that the sub might want to be extra careful with. These details will generally be the same for each semester. 

Only include this if there's something unusual for the sub to know about. (For instance, I had a class with a student with a behavioral problem. On asking him to do his work, he lost his temper, and threw a desk at the door before storming out. Another teacher at the school advised me that this particular student can never be told to do anything - he must be asked in as gentle of terms as possible. That would have been useful to know ahead of time.)

## Lesson Plan

* If you've got younger students, it's a good idea to briefly mention why you're absent. (Meeting, illness, doctor's appointment, etc). Younger students are sometimes afraid when a teacher is gone, especially if they didn't expect it or remember the teacher mentioning it.
* Include the class times for each part of the lesson plan, even if it's mentioned elsewhere. The sub will probably be carrying this paper everywhere s/he goes, and that makes the timetable easy access.
* Indicate the type of class this is, beyond the basic subject, if applicable. Things like whether this is a behavioral class, advanced class, etc.
* Please don't include things like references to the program of studies / curriculum information. We just need info on what we, personally, need to do, not why it's being done.
* If the substitute needs access to something (a file, a youtube video, etc) make sure you include a way to get to it. If something like a youtube video, try to avoid using links - better to include the name of the video. Half the time, links are used on printed lesson plans, which involve trying to type it out by hand, which sometimes doesn't work. Sometimes, it's electronic, but the link is broken.
* If the plan involves electronics, please include a backup course of action. Sometimes computers are problematic. Students often refuse to listen to what a sub says, but if a sub can point out that the teacher said to do it, then the students will listen. Anything you put on the lesson plan is ammo the sub can use against rebellious students, if necessary.
* Make the different classes obviously, visually distinct, such as with a header separating each of the classes. I have had cases where a teacher has left what looked like an essay, with no way to see what I needed to work on at a glance.
* It can be helpful to do time breakdowns for each part of the plan. IE, allow 15 minutes to complete X, then allow 20 minutes to talk about Y, and so forth. Since we work with vastly different age groups, it's easy to misjudge how much time will be required for various parts of the plan.
* Depending on the material, it can be useful to clarify how much you expect the students to already know. IE, whether a powerpoint slide is a review or new information will dramatically change how it should be presented.

## When you get back

It's a good idea to ask your students about how the sub was, and compare that to how much material was covered (if you let the sub teach). Most teachers would appreciate a substitute that they can rely on to do a good job, and most subs *really* want teachers they regularly work for. Knowing ahead of time what jobs we're working, as well as getting to know the kids, can make the day less stressful, and it can therefore be easier to do a good job.

-------

While all of these are useful and recommended, the most useful tips would be to include parking information in the assignment posting, to include school policy information, and to have concise, clearly differentiated lesson plans.

I'd love to run a question by you guys and see what your thoughts are on this matter. 

I'm in my 5th year teaching 7th grade. This past fall I began teaching at a new school in a new county. I have always had strong relationships with my students that have never been anything close to inappropriate. There are a few that I have allowed to follow me on Instagram and Facebook after they are no longer my students. 

I have one female student that I grew particularly close to. We'll call her G. I am also female and I saw a lot of myself in her. She doesn't have much support at home and also struggles with anxiety/depression. Dad is not in the picture and mom is disabled. Her older sister just graduated high school and is often at friend's places and such. Toward the end of the school year her mom had a seizure and I was there for her during that time. This summer (after she was no longer my student) G requested to follow me on Instagram and I accepted. 

Moving schools this fall has been difficult for a myriad of reasons, but I hate that I'm not able to check in with my former babies that I've taught. I often had former students stopping by my room and keeping in touch. G has messaged me a few times on IG letting me know she misses me and we've communicated about school, colorguard, etc. 

Last night, she messaged me to let me know that her mom was back in the hospital due to having additional seizures. I really want to be here for this girl. I feel like she really needs someone but I don't know what to do. Do I contact her school counselor? Do I get in touch with her mom (once she's a little better) and see if I can take G to grab some ice cream or something? I would love to go out to my old school and have lunch with her but due to teaching in a new school ~40 minutes away I'm unable to. 

I want to maintain appropriate boundaries and am turning to you guys to see if you've experienced something similar. How can I best be there for G in an appropriate way?",,73myyw,,0,,false,1510384793,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/73myyw/appropriate_friendly_relationships_with_former/,,,,,

Don’t expect perfectly accurate ‘how to be a pro at SC2’ advice below. For a while after it was just released, I played a lot, but I haven’t really been back since then. That said, I see a lot of analogies between teaching and being a good RTS player. Keep in mind that everything below is written from the perspective of a K-8 Teacher, since that’s where I’m at.

* Micromanagement

Class sizes in modern classrooms are much too large. This is sort of a fact of life: realistically, our government’s priorities mean that there isn’t enough money to pay for teachers for a 1 to 12 ratio, or whatever small size is ideal, so it’s up to teachers to find opportunities to work one-on-one and in small group with their students. Just as a pro SC2 player will always beat a novice player even though they have a smaller-cost army (I can’t count the number of times that a handful of well microed marines beat my much more expensive army of Zealots, Lings, or most shamefully of all: marines), a pro Teacher will be skillful in their one-on-one and small group teaching. These teachers will be able to effectively teach students when working with them closely. We teachers wear many hats, and ‘tutor’ is definitely among them. That said, the best tutor in the world isn’t necessarily a good teacher due to the aforementioned class sizes. This, of course, brings us to:

* Crowd Control

This might be more based on my World of Warcraft experience, but I’m sure there are some forms of CC in Starcraft (Protoss Force Fields from Sentries?) Anyway, as a teacher in a classroom, you’re typically outnumbered 1 to 30. If you’re pretty sure that you can only teach 1 on 10 or so for in-depth learning, that means you need to come up with some forms of Crowd Control. Things like: independent stations, or small group activities that are more-or-less self-guided. At my school, we use a lot of computer programs that work with students on their math skills and language arts skills. These programs aren’t bad overall, but their biggest effect is giving teachers opportunities to focus on controlling tight-knit groups while the rest of the class is occupied. My classrooms usually use 20 minute or so stations in which I work with a third of the class at the time while the other 2/3 are CCed on something educational that doesn’t require a teacher to directly work with them.

* Macro

I consider resource management to be the most appealing part of any game, so naturally, I was drawn to the macro elements of SC2. I never had the perfect reflexes and timing necessary to be a good micro-er, so to rank up, I had to have an efficient Macro-system of collecting, protecting, and expanding my resource accumulation. If a pro’s 10 marines could kite my 15 and win, I’d just bring 20 or 25 to the fight! As a teacher, I think Macro is represented by my time management inside and out of work. The one thing that separates me from many other teachers at my school is that I’m always working. I get to school early and often leave after most others have left. This isn’t because I’m not ‘working smart’, it’s because I’m doing things that require time: I’m volunteering to host after-school clubs, I’m constantly in contact with parents of students through conferences or phone calls, and I’m reflecting on my own teaching practices. I give feedback on assignments that is specific and timely. I spend most of my lunches eating with my class, building a rapport that I couldn’t possibly have without the ‘breathing time’ that outside of classtime provides me. This is my macro, my extra resources that I bring that others don’t have.

* Know your Units Strengths and Weaknesses

Only an idiot or desperate SC2 player would pit their Reapers head to head against a group of Stalkers. No matter how good your micro is, the stalkers are going to chew them up. The reapers would be better utilized somewhere else, such as behind enemy lines where the workers are playing. Just the same, a good teacher works to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each of their students. When I was obsessed with SC2, I remember reading up on different unit’s counters, tactics, and weaknesses so that I knew how to handle different situations in game. These days, when I’m teaching, I listen to my students, confer with their parents and other teachers as I work to find out their strengths, interests, and weaknesses. This effort always pays off, as I find ways to combo student abilities to make their learning more efficient and engaging. Some groups of friends work great together in small groups, and others need to be kept very far apart during class time. Some students benefit from being seated close to me, and others do just fine while working relatively independently. If a student is having a hard time at home, that’s something for me to keep in mind if I see them ‘acting up’ in class. If you don’t know your units well, you’re definitely not going to utilize your time with them efficiently.

* Scouting in Early Game

The teaching to SC2 analogies never seem to cease. I think when I first played SC2, I was reluctant to scout the enemy’s base at the start of the game. A little because I was lazy… I’d rather sit easy in my base that have to worry about the safety of a worker sent out into the dark. A little because I thought “but why would I use this worker to scout, when I could use it to get more resources (See Macro section, above.) That said, ultimately I didn’t scout because I knew that no matter what I saw, I wouldn’t be changing my build. I was too new to recognize the patterns of my opponent’s base. The vision my scout provided me with was useless beyond “where on the mini-map I will direct my giant army at the end of the game”. I started each game with a plan, and played out that plan without regard for what my opponent was doing until it was too late (either for me or them). Later, as I got better at the game, I would come to appreciate the value of scouting. It let me predict my enemy’s builds, which then helped shape my own decisions throughout the game. As a teacher, ‘scouting’ represents differentiation. Students have different needs. You can’t just go the same build every game of Starcraft 2 and expect to win (unless you’re crazy under-rated, or there’s something broken that requires a nerf hammer). Just the same, we can’t expect every student to learn the same way. Your class of students is not grouped logically. It’s a room full of kids who happen to be the same age. Some of them will be really ahead, and others will be really behind. Some of them will have a high vocabulary, but terrible comprehension skills, while others may have the reverse. Teachers have to use assessment, things like formative quizzes or observations to guide our day-to-day decisions (as well as long-term planning). Your ‘teaching build’ has to include consideration of all the things that your scouting reveals. It needs to probe, and take advantage of the flaws in their defense. It requires a finesse, a repertoire of teaching strategies to be able to handle all the diverse needs of each student.

----------------------------------------

There you have it. I think a lot more analogies could be drawn (Keeping up with the Meta = Professional Development?), but I’ll save those for my next article...

I played Starcraft 2 to win. I worked to climb the ranks of platinum, and eventually diamond, and even flirted with Master league for a while… This required daily practice, constant reflection over my replays, and observing/reading about strategies that other players were using. This is the same sort of focus and obsession that I bring to teaching. I make it my goal to win, using all the small tools I’ve picked up over my lifetime. Finally, Starcraft 2 and teaching share a crucial similarity: at the end of the day, I’m having a ton of fun while doing it.

Not sure if this is the right place to ask; please let me know if there's a better sub to utilize.  I am a graduate student studying higher education and student affairs leadership (graduate with my master's in April).  Over the past year, I've discovered I really want to stay close to where I live now, which is really hard to do in student affairs.  I know most high schools have college counselors that advise students on finding colleges, admissions process, identifying needs they'll have once they enter college, etc.  I think I could do this job (I love educating students about the opportunities higher education can offer, and I've developed pretty good communication, advising, and empathy skills over the past two years as a GA in an advising office), and applying for this type of job would greatly increase my odds of being able to stay in the region.  

I see that many who do this job have a master's in counseling.  Does anyone know the flexibility a Student Affairs degree has in translating to this role?  Or is it one of those things where it just isn't possible?",,75x9vy,,0,,false,1510426908,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/75x9vy/higher_education_student_interested_in_college/,,,,,

I found out this morning one of my kids that graduated last Spring died in a car accident this morning. He was a truly magnificent young man, smart, kind, a consummate actor, and never got into trouble. I woke up to several emails, Remind messages, and texts from students, alumni, and other teachers asking if I had heard the news. 

My heart is broken. I've cried off and on all day and I know I'll cry more tomorrow as I see his friends walk into the theater. I'm mad. I'm furious that he will not get the chance to experience life they way he should have. I'm devastated that a mother will have to bury her son a week before she was going to throw a party in celebration of his first appearance on a TV pilot. He had so much to live for and it was ripped from his hands. 

I'm tired of it. I'm tired of my children having to weep year after year as they mourn for their friends. I'm tired of having to watch their parents walk across the stage at graduation to receive an honorary diploma. I don't know if I can stand walking up to another open casket to look at the face of a young man or woman whom I can't share a smile with anymore. 

After I lost my first student two years ago, everyone told me to take solace in that the chances of it happening again would be slim. And hear I am about to attend another funeral that shouldn't be happening at all. 

I love my job, there is no other profession I could ever be in. But no one ever prepared me for the heartbreak of losing a child, much less three. I'm not sure where exactly I'm going with this, but I needed to vent. Good vibes would be appreciated for tomorrow. 

Edit: I can honestly say that today was the most difficult day of my career. I’ve spent so many tears that my head is pounding. I’m exhausted and my poor students are broken.  The viewing is tomorrow and the funeral is Wednesday. Please, hug your loved ones. Ask how your kids’ day is going. Love them while you can.

Are all classes of teenagers awful?,"A couple of years ago, I decided to transition from working in higher education to teaching high school, so that I would have more geographic flexibility. I was a long-term substitute in an 11th grade class for about a semester in a small, working class town in Wisconsin, then I moved to a mid-sized urban area and began teaching 9th grade in a public school.

I loved teaching 11th grade that semester and a half. Yes, it was an adjustment, but I only occasionally felt seriously insulted by my students, and most kids did most of their work, most of the time. Just about everyone showed improvement and learned.

In my current context, however, it's difficult to get most students to engage in simple tasks, or even to listen to instructions long enough to play a game (even if they are written on the board). My students yell and curse at me daily, and have occasionally even gone as far as to make really messed up sexual remarks towards me (which I documented and addressed with admin). They constantly make fun of my hair and clothing.

So my question is: what gives? Is it 9th grade? The different setting (100%  free lunch program;  25% transient; mean reading grade equivalent of 4th grade)? I'd like to continue teaching high school, but my 2 1/2 years in this situation has been demoralizing, and I don't see things as being much better in other teachers' classrooms. 
I'm not sure if I should quit teaching kids altogether, if my skin's too thin, or if most schools aren't like this.

I’m pursuing an MLIS but the environment I’m in is becoming toxic (gossip, breaches of confidentiality, my supervisor still uses the r-word when referring to those with intellectual or developmental differences such as myself, etc.). So, I’m considering shifting gears completely until spring 2019, when I graduate, or perhaps, if I find something else I fall in love with, beyond spring 2019.

I love the idea of being a college tutor. I have a lot of the educational qualifications (I majored in anthropology and minored in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages and graduated Cum Laude) and I’m certainly not overqualified. I also have some volunteering experience in the ESL field and got a training certificate from a literacy organization specifically in doing that. Yesterday, I found out that the main community college system (I actually got my Associate in Arts from one of the campuses) is covered under the same union as the library I’m at now, so it is still considered a city job and I wouldn’t lose any of my protections. They have a lot of tutoring positions open right now, many in subjects I am not only good at but love to teach others about. 

So, my questions are as follows:
-Is this worth doing? Putting passions aside, how well would a city community college tutoring job pay as opposed to a library clerical position? I don’t need a six-figure salary, and I would do this out of love for the job, but I do need to pay the bills.
-What can I bring to the table? Most of my career has been spent in libraries—I volunteered for years, was in an “elite” teenage group that helped with YA library programming, and helped the librarians with reference projects as a page. Would any of this lend itself well to the tutoring field, or make me a semi-standout?
-Finally, if I do choose this path, what’s the biggest nugget of wisdom you can pass on?

Wow, that was long. Apologies. But if you made it this far, thank you—and any advice is appreciated! :)",,7gn7qm,,0,,false,1512327897,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7gn7qm/pondering_shifting_gears_from_library_clerical/,,,,,

I want to teach college-level film. I'm never happier than I am when discussing movies. I first had this thought about a year after I graduated when I was just freelancing. I went to a local community college to take care of some prerequisites that I would need in order to transition to film studies. I stopped doing that when I got my first full time job (which I loathed). Then I moved to NY for a year for a graphic design and that just further fueled my love for film, and now I'm back from NY, unemployed, and really wanting to pursue a career teaching film. 

I want y'all to give it to me straight. What do I need to do to make this happen? About how much will it cost? Will I need to get another Bachelor's degree or could I go straight into a MAT? I know nothing about what is required to be a college level teacher, so help me out here, Reddit!

Sorry if this is long but I don't know what information you teachers might need to help me out. Also sorry for any grammatical errors I get yelled at enough saying her 3rd grade class could do better(jokingly…. I hope lol)

My GF teaches 3rd grade in a small district in South Jersey. During parent teacher conferences she told the parents of the student that she has observed some weird behavior in their kid. She informed them that even though he sits in the front of the class he stands up quite often saying he can't see the board and other times he can see fine. The parents said they noticed it also when he was playing video games and were going to make an appointment with a doctor. Last week on our anniversary she got an email from the parents saying that he did not have any vision in his right eye and he probably didn't since he was a baby. He has coped with it since and that why he never said anything was wrong. The doctor scheduled an emergency MRI to scan for a tumor. She was devastated and broke down crying. That is when I started looking for ideas for her to help the student at least see the board. The kid is his normal happy go lucky self and didn't have any change in his attitude when he went to school on Monday. She got an email today confirming the poor kid has a tumor(i do not know where). I know she loves her students this year and it's gonna hit her hard. 

So outside of the normal bf consoling duties is there anything extra a non teacher could do to help a teacher out when they get information like this? Also do any of you have any ideas/free software/ anything that might help a teacher teach a kid that has trouble seeing the board? I do not know when/if the student will be in class after this but I would like to have some ideas for her.

Thank you for any and all of your help!!

This is my first year teaching, and was excited to be employed in the district that I am. I teach math and science to 50 5th graders split between two classes. 

My first class has a desire to learn, and even the ones that struggle, TRY. And I'm okay with trying, I appreciate it and I can work with it. 

My second class however, is the very opposite. They don't care for my teaching, for learning, or for trying at all. Students will come up to me and say that they don't care about what they're doing, that if they fail it's my fault not theirs. The kids will tell me that they didn't study because they didn't care. 
I had a student who OPENLY cheated on a test. I gave her a 0, after MULTIPLE chances to stop after being caught. Her mother came to the school raised cain to the principal and the kid ended up getting to retake the test, AT HOME, with help! 
So now she doesn't care about what she does because she feels there will be no consequences. 

Math is 90 minutes. When they have tests and even quizzes! they get the whole time to do it. Some kids will still hand in their test with 2 questions done and say it's my fault. 

They don't write down the notes, they don't participate in class activities, (and not for nothing I pride myself on making math a FUN subject.)

I truly don't know what to do. It breaks my heart to see some of the grades these kids are getting in my class and i'm continuously am trying to help them bump their grade up. 

They get extensions on their projects, I'll reprint homework assignments so they can do them again, let them retake tests for half credit if they get below a 70. I give them extra credit, I set up tutoring 3 times a week, I make sure to review everything with the kids before exams, I give them two weeks notice for them all. 


I don't know what to do. 
I am truly at a loss. 

I don't want to get fired at the end of the year for a low grade average. 

I really don't know what to do.

But my old soccer coach is the department chair of social studies at the high school I went to. I was talking to him recently and he said the master's I get didn't really matter as long as I had good reviews from mentors when student teaching. He also said he would consider an exclusively online program like American College of Education.

Does anybody have any thoughts about ACE? I am really considering William Carey University as well, it's 340 a credit and according to US News it's the #56 online education program.

It only requires me to submit my transcripts , recommendations, and ACT scores from high school.

I am just wondering if these are good schools, I want to do a fully online program as I am a substitute and I coach club and high school soccer.

Also I am strongly considering getting certified through Teacher Ready, although I wouldn't get my masters but from what I understand I could transfer credits over after I get my certification, and I could be done within 6-9 months. But, I'm worried I wouldn't get enough student teaching experience.

Our cooperating teachers let us come up with a project that they wanted and it just had to meet certain expectations. The issue we are having is with rotating groups when they present. 

We will be in the library on presentation day. There are 5 groups of 4, and 5 groups of 3. They are researching different themes from the 50s/Cold War. The students must present their findings to their classmates in an on going presentation at the library. So they are all presenting at once but we need to make sure the students get to all the other groups to learn the content. And that is our dilemma. We can not think of a proper rotation so that everyone hears each other’s topic. Our best thought is to just let them go freely, figuring they will figure it out. 

Class is an honors class (highly self motivated kids, and class is roughly 90 minutes long)

I teach 4th grade. This kid has ADHD (unmedicated) and has some emotional issues (depression, mood swings - also unmedicated). He doesn't have the greatest home life, but it's not the worst either. Hands down, he is a bully. He's been calling girls fat (gave one of them body image issues so badly she now has to be forced to eat), going out of his way to show his disdain for others, and has been in trouble for pushing. He is outright disrespectful to teachers and students, but thankfully the one pushing issue was (apparently) in self defense and there's never been another violent issue.

He lies constantly and he is so good at negotiating. He's charming af and of course he's very cute. This, I'm sure, will get him far in life but it's not working on me or anyone else at school. I do think it works on mom though.

We don't have much support from her. She keeps saying things like, ""that's just how he is"" and ""he doesn't act that way at home"". Well of course not...he just plays Xbox all day at home (which is why his hw is never done!). Anyway..

He has broken all trust I have in him. I literally have to be watching him 100% of the time or he's not doing what he's supposed to be doing. He's searching up ""fart"" on his Chromebook or making hate lists or intentionally distracting someone else. Anything to get out of doing his work. He's so ADHD he can't focus on anything long enough to get it done and then he makes really poor choices on top of that.

So that's the background. Here's the actual story:

Today he stayed in for recess because...

1.) he went to the nurse without asking (went after he asked to go to the bathroom) to get ice because he ""tripped"" in the hallway. He was then eating the ice. 

2.) he didn't do his reading assignment despite having nearly 40 minutes to do it in class during independent time.

3.) he didn't do his rocket math even after I reminded the entire class to do it before they started their keyboarding. I told him he would have to do it during recess, so he did it during Daily 5 instead. So that's a double whammy.

SO...while he was in, he was obviously rushing through his work. He is clearly not doing his reading assignments so he just wrote down anything for the answer to the chapter question. I told him it was incorrect and he needed to go back and re-read and stop and jot on a sticky after each page to remember. This is when he started getting angry. He was slamming and saying ""this is stupid"" and ""I hate this"" which I usually just ignore (choose your battles, you know?). He tried again (rushed without reading) and of course it was still wrong. So I asked him if he read it. He said yes. So I told him to tell me what the chapter was about and he said he couldn't remember (lies). I told him he's not taking his time to read and understand if he can't remember and he needs to take his time and actually read it this time. Here goes...

Him: I don't understand why I have to stay in, this is so stupid!

Me: Well, who's fault is that?

Him: It's not mine!

Me: Well it certainly isn't my fault. We have rules in this classroom.

Him: *mumble* I hate you.
   
Obviously I heard him and so did a couple other students. This has never happened to me so I literally didn't know what to do. I left the room to look for other 4th grade teachers (ALL of them were out of their rooms) to ask what to do. When I couldn't find anyone, I literally just stayed outside my room waiting. I didn't want to be around him. I talked to my colleague and she said I needed to send him the the principal's office. When I came back in the room, he was crying and a bunch of kids were crowded around him. Ugh.

So he knows he's in trouble now. He apologized but I ignored him. Principal came down and got him. Talked outside, he came back in. She watched him for a bit then left.

THIS IS THE REAL ISSUE HERE. After, he came up to me and apologized again. Then we talked. I told him how he needs to do his work and be held accountable and blah blah blah. He started talking about his parent's divorce. What? So he's crying about this now. I sent him to the school psych. 

Principal comes back to check on him and I told him I sent him down. She said it's bullshit and he's using it as an excuse. SO THIS IS MY DILEMMA - does this kid have so many emotions that they just explode out of him when he's angry and upset, or is he so good that he knows how to con me into feeling bad for him after an incident like this? I am a very compassionate person and I don't care if this kid just spit in my face - he's crying and he looks like he's actually in pain. And remember, he is only 10 years old. It's very hard for me to think of him as this evil genius. 

Still called mom - no answer. Left a message. I don't expect a reply. 

PLEASE HELP.

TLDR: held a kid accountable, he said he hated me, got in trouble w/ principal, cried about parent's divorce which was 8 years ago. Can't tell if he's a manipulative mastermind and using it to get out of trouble or this kid just bottles his emotions until he explodes and actually needs some serious help.

Some things and thoughts I've had after years in education:

-  Teaching is the embodiment of America's piss poor work culture. I've seen so many teachers basically bragging about how many hours they put in a week and take a condescending attitude towards anyone who works less or finds shortcuts in the job. It's no wonder the standards aren't getting any better when there's people like this

- To go with the above point, I really hate how our education system makes it seem like it's either giving your life to teaching and forgetting your own goals/hobbies or finding another job that lets you have that balance. Not saying it's impossible, but from my own experiences and most teachers I meet, this is the reality

- Administrators seem to forget that this isn't about them, it's about the students. I moved to a new school this year, my students love me, their parents love me, but I am not, and never have been, someone who kisses ass or blindly accepts things just because. Admin (and a couple of other teachers) don't like that, so they've made the year miserable for me. Because who cares if you're doing the job well and the students are happy if your own ego is bruised, right?

- One of the ironies of teaching: the pettiest and most passive aggressive people I've met have also happened to be teachers, which is bizarre considering we're supposed to be teaching our students empathy/sympathy, understanding, and being polite and respectful to one another. If only parents could see how some of these teachers really are. I've met a lot of teachers who just lovely, wonderful people, but the amount of basically immature people I've met in the profession is astonishing 

- Another irony: for as much as we get preached to about differentiation and accepting that students have different ways of thinking and doing things, we also forget that adults are often the same way. Not every teacher is going to do things the same way, or have the same attitude/personality/whatever, but a lot of teachers I meet (and some admin) don't seem to appreciate the differences that exist 

Anyone else notice these things? Or have your own things to add?",,7zpd7a,,0,,false,1520585780,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7zpd7a/some_thoughts_and_reflections_on_teaching_feel/,,,,,

Each week is dedicated to a story, split into five days with grammar, writing, etc

The problem is, the creators of this curriculum seem to have unrealistic expectations of a) what students can achieve in a single day, and b) what most students' skill level is in language arts. It's more of an ""In an ideal world..."" type thing than a realistic expectation, and each week I practically dread planning ELA because I'm stuck trying to figure out what is ""important"" and what can be glossed over or skipped outright

To make matters a little more complicated, my grade level team insists on stretching each story to two weeks instead of one. While I think there's too much going on for each day in how the book wants it, I also know that stretching it out to two weeks leaves me scrambling for how to fill time (we're supposed to do ELA daily for 90 minutes)

I'm going to experiment on my own next week and try something new, but in the meantime, any suggestions or advice would be appreciated. How do you do ELA in your class? Activity ideas are cool too

**Edit in case anyone is confused:** Given my students' skill level in ELA (I teach third grade, most are barely at or are below grade level, while a couple are barely second grade), doing all the stuff they recommend in a single day in a 90 minute block would be too much, given how much help some of them would need. But stretching it out to a two week period leaves me trying to figure out how to fill time, because this wasn't a curriculum designed for two weeks.

I feel like I'm okay when planning and preparing but when i have to go up and do my lesson I feel like my nerves start kicking in and I don't explain things the way I intended to or can't add on once a student answers a question correctly. 

Most feedback I've gotten from my professor is just to speak louder. I'm naturally just a soft spoken/shy person so I feel like I struggle with this. My professors say I just need to find my teaching voice so I sound more confident. Explaining things better is something I've been told is a suggested area for growth. 

But one thing I feel discouraged and sort of embarrassed about is the cooperating teacher I was with last semester at my placement is friends with my professor for my science class. well this girl in my science class was talking to my professor and telling her how she got placed with the same cooperating teacher I had last semester is friends with my professor). And then I overheard my professor telling the girl in my class, ""oh yeah, my friend was telling me that she had an intern last semester and that sometimes she would forget she was even there and she had to do her video lesson and it was terrible"" And I know for a fact she was talking about me because it was the first time she ever had an intern in her class.

I've heard it all too often: as a teacher, you need good supports! You need a supportive family, supportive friends. Someone to talk to, someone to vent to.

My partner and I have gone through a lot in our 7 years together, and I'd like to think we've made significant progress!

But one thing bothers me, and it's maybe not so much a ""non-teacher spouse"" issue as a simply ""him"" issue. Basically, I feel he is completely uninterested in my career. He partly helped me see the light that teaching was for me but beyond the first job interview and first day on the job about 2 years ago, there has been little interest on his part about much relating to my job. Unless it's something broader like systemic issues that he can maybe relate to, or anything negative he is slightly more engaged, or he may occasionally bash the salary I make...  (admittedly I bash that too).

On a positive note, I'm remembering now that he DID send a letter to our elected official recently to protest some reforms that are NOT for the betterment of students, upon little prompting from me. This really impressed me.

However, there are days where I would so appreciate him asking, ""how were the kids today?"" or.. I don't know. Something? We don't communicate about much when our toddler is awake, period. Maybe this is normal for parents of toddlers. We all eat dinner together so you would think it would be a good time to catch up. Except that it ends up being me asking him about his day, and him redirecting the conversation to our 2 year old so that *he* may tell me what they did. But there is no reciprocation. He doesn't even feign interest in what I did/taught/dealt with. He doesn't ask a single thing. He thinks I'm ""too invested"", ""too wrapped up in it"". 

We've had this conversation time and again, about my husband never asking me things, and my husband has always been of the mindset that if I have anything to say, I can just say it. He's not going to ask me ""how was your day, honey?"" He just won't. So it's up to me to bring up whatever I want to talk about. Fine, we've done that for years now. It doesn't make me the happiest, but I've mostly accepted that that's the way it has to be. 

I could understand his annoyance if all I talked about was school. But I pretty rarely bring it up. And as all you fellow teachers know, it's an all-consuming job that is so difficult to put aside! Even on your time off. So it's a pretty big feat for me to have reduced talking about it to a couple times per week. Today I brought up this new pedagogy I tried, and had been excited to try, and his reaction was very clearly ""why would I care?"" He doesn't ask any further questions and sometimes in these situations abruptly and sort of rudely changes the topic. Today he grunted and that was it.

What I'm asking, I guess, is for examples of how you and your non-teaching spouse communicate about your job. Because, if I were to ask my spouse to improve in some way, I wouldn't quite be sure how to describe what I want. More interest, for sure, but that isn't something I can force on him. It boils down to him taking an interest in me, and maybe that is lacking. At least, it feels to me like it is. 

So how do you communicate about teaching? And also, how do you prevent teaching from consuming your personal life too? Obviously you don't want it to be ALL you talk about with your partner.

I have the sped teacher come into my classroom every afternoon to help me out with our writing block, since every kid needs a lot of support when they are this young. 

Well, yesterday I had a kid come up and we sounded out boat. She spelled it b-o-t, whiling is perfect since buh-oh-tuh is how it sounds when you sound it out. 

It's not spelled right but that isn't important at this point in their development. 

Well, a few minutes later the kid comes back to me and shows me her page with boat spelled correctly, and I'm like ""wow, how'd you figure that out?!"" And she tells me ""oh, Mrs. (sped) told me but she said it's a secret"".

I. Am. Furious. 

First off, don't tell my kids to keep secrets from me. Second off, I've explained about inventive spelling and why we use it.  Additionally, this teacher has no educational background whatsoever. 

She has been teaching since the beginning of January. So 2 1/2 months. Which is fine, she’s being trained currently, but if you don’t know what you’re doing and the teacher whose classroom you are in tells you to do something a certain way, then do that! 

I don’t want my kids discouraged from trying to spell things on their own. It’s what they need to be doing now. They need to feel proud that they phonetically sounded a word out, not corrected behind my back and then told to hide it from me. 

I don’t know how to approach this teacher to talk about this. I am very non-confrontational.

Hope everyone is enjoying their summer right now. I'm a teacher that is going into their 5th year or teaching physics and AP Physics at a school listed on the federal loan forgiveness site.

My degree is in chemical engineering, and I realized about two years into this job that teaching wasn't for me. Unfortunately, it's been explained to me that my chances of getting back into engineering at this point are slim to none unless I get my master's degree. Of course, I'm not going to be the one to pay for that.

I have no active student loans from undergrad, as I was able to pay them off. Clearly, I should be able get $17,500 to pay for grad school (depending on where I go, this could pay for my Master's in full with no money out of my pocket).

Based on the website, so long as I take out the loan before the end of my 5th year, I'd be clear to do this. Anyone who's more knowledgeable about this want to chime in if this reasoning is correct?

There are things I like about teaching that aren’t necessarily true for speech language pathology so it’s making me lean toward education.

I just finished my BTSA Year 1. Unfortunately, my district RIFed me (and many other teachers), and I don't have any guarantees that I'll be rehired where I was, though my department and administrators want me back. That's what they said, at least.

Anyway, I've got an interview with another district next week, and am waiting to hear a response to the other 6 applications I submitted via EDJOIN this past week.

If, for whatever reason, I don't manage to land another full-time position, and can't clear my credential by the October 2018 deadline, what can I do?

I've heard that one has to contact CA's Dept. of Education and basically pay a $100 fee for an additional extension, but not from someone who has actually had to go through this process. So, I was wondering if anyone else here has gone through this.

Thanks.

**Edit (7/10/2017)**: I finally had some time to sit down and search, and I'm pretty sure I found the answer to my own question. I'm posting the link below for the benefit of anyone else who might find him- or herself in this situation.

1. Related to my 2 posts in [AskAcademia](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/6lfbna/is_it_worth_doing_phd_full_time_given_masters_and/)
 and in [GradSchool](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/6lfg9x/is_it_worth_doing_phd_full_time_given_masters_and/) where I asked about **backups in education centres in case PhD doesn't work out** (like I finish, want to continue to academic jobs but don't get any or who knows).

2. **This may depend on country**. Any info or advice is appreciated because it would give me an understanding of how things work here even if different (I don't expect it to be vastly different though?) elsewhere.

&amp;nbsp;

Personal context:

&amp;nbsp;

1. May 2016: **Finished master's** and then moved back home to **apply for PhD programmes** and **get started on my desired career** (besides academia), which was **teaching in schools or education/tutorial centres**.

2. September 2016: **Started part time work in a centre** (full time hard to find, and schools weren't replying).

3. December 2016 or January 2017: **Spoke with HR from a school** I applied (actually, career fair) in November 2016 (also spoke with her during application) who told me that for international schools, since they have a lot of applicants, they choose those with **degrees in education** (bachelor's/master's in education or PGDE/PGCE) or at least sufficient **teaching experience abroad** (where I got my master's, teachers usually don't have education degrees). She said she wasn't sure if it applied to local schools, but I have a feeling that's the case as well.

&amp;nbsp;

**So what does this mean for me?** If full time PhD substitutes for an education degree, then:

1. **I don't have to think about doing PhD part time or working part time in centres while doing PhD full time** (though if part time work wouldn't be that much, then why not) or anything like that.

2. **I can just focus on PhD full time**

3. If I can't find or get academic jobs, then **I will be fine teaching in schools**.

Just not very big sample sizes, besides elementary.

Eventually when I go back home, I want to pick one age group and stick with it, and the hardest part of deciding is the sinking feeling I get when I have to teach a class that, well, hates it.

You find them all the time. It could be because of the material, or the teacher's style. Or it could just be the kids. But certain groups always seem more likely to be miserable than others.

4th-6th grade, for example, might get bored easily, but it's also really easy to amuse them and have a blast. Below that they're even more excitable and just harder to control. Whatever, though, because *I do not want to teach elementary* in the future.

High school students on the other hand, I only have experience teaching them Les Miserables, which was a voluntary class, so *of course* every kid was having a blast. 

Middle school, well... it's hit or miss. Some 7th graders are decent, but most just want to sleep. They're in school from 7am until 10pm, some even til midnight. They hate their lives and many of them genuinely want to die. It's basically legalized child abuse. So I have no idea if this is normal for middle school or not.

What age groups do you think hate life the most and make teaching the most miserable? Boisterous, I can handle that, but apathetic is harsh.

The class will be very small (10 students) and will have students who have a reading age of about 5. I am most concerned about a student who has moderate/severe learning disabilities (specifically memory problems), high EAL needs and also has pretty intense hearing problems. 

From my discussions with the LSAs most of my students will have little understanding of any implicit readings, will not understand sarcasm/inferences and will need incredibly simple language. Many will have scribes and are unable to write in full sentences.

Lastly, due to cuts at the school for year 10 (first year of GCSE) they were in a class of 30 with no support. They most likely have not learned much at all this year.


How am I supposed to get my students to memorise and be able to analyse difficult texts??  Any help on teaching students with special needs would be incredibly helpful


*These are the standardised tests in the UK. It consists of 4 tests which include Macbeth, Jekyll and Hyde, 18 poems, unseen poetry, an inspector calls, unseen fiction and unseen nonfiction (including 19th century) as well as persuasive and creative writing. The tests require tons of memorisation (quotes from all the poems and texts)

I know for certain that I want to go through grad school at some point, but I'm not sure when would be best. 
I'll be graduating this upcoming spring with my Bachelors degree in History with a minor in Political Science and certifications in Secondary Education and Museums. (I kinda wanted to cast as large of a net as possible in the hopes of finding some sort of a job.)  I would like to start paying off some of my student loan debt before piling on more with grad school, and figured that a teacher's salary would certainly do that better than my current part time minimum wage job.  However, I'm concerned that my chances of getting into a graduate program will only decrease after graduation, as my connections to different professors who could write recommendations and whatnot will only fade.  This in mind, it would obviously be ideal to simply do both, but I imagine that would very nearly kill me to go through my starting years of teaching at the same time as grad school.  
The way I see it, I have two options, either just continue on to grad school or to teach for a few years before attempting to take on grad school.  As I'm sure that this is all to common of a predicament, I'd love to hear what other people have done/wish that they had done.

Everything is funny: a friend making faces across the room, the way I ask for their attention, someone's squeaky chair, my outfit/shoes, and on and on. These outbursts are almost as loud as someone just yelling/screaming and just as distracting.

I've changed seating charts so the worst offenders aren't sitting near each other. Other than that, I've mostly been asking them to lower the volume or be silent while I'm instructing, or telling them to get a little self controlin the more ridiculous situations. They don't seem to understand how they could possibly control laughter; it's like a completely foreign concept to be asked to regulate their emotions (or at least how they display emotions). 

What would you do here? Has anyone dealt with this before?

A quick example was our school football team (which I was very involved in) which consisted of the A's and the B's. Logically the most capable students would be in the A's while the ones who need extra development would be in the B's. But I was often questioned why certain children were placed in the B's despite what being in the B team obviously represents. Then I was given sob stories about how this child and that child were upset because they didn't make it into the A's and how unfair the selection process was etc.  

This happened weekly and every single time the teacher gave in and let them 'have a go' in the A's. The problem is that we then had to move some children down from the A's into the B's! In both scenarios we are getting bombarded with complaints.  

Since I will soon have to deal with these sorts of situations I'd appreciate if anyone could give me any advice, how do you deal with parents who are **constantly** telling you about how their special little pupil needs extra attention?

I'm always calling him out because he is constantly distracted and playing around, and also distracting others. Sometimes he is mean to other kids. When I call him out, he stops, and this kid is like everytime I give him a serious word about how he is disrupting the class or being mean and that I have to punish him by not going to the game at weekend, he gives that ""sad face"" which I believe he thinks it works to get him out of trouble, maybe he uses it with his mother everytime she is angry and, she doesn't want him to get sad probably excuses him everytime he does the sad look. 

The thing is, I can punish him more and I believe that can work, but I would like to know different approaches, maybe try to understand why he has to be mean to other kids and how that relates to him not having a father around. Maybe try to gain his respect in some other way. I don't know.

Thank you for your input guys. You gave me some ideas for better coaching him. 
I'm always stern with him, I was afraid he get the impression that I don't like him and I just punish him and not others.

Still, I wonder what the liklyhood of me finding a job as a media specalist are. 

This is a little bit of a vent I suppose to, since I am not sure if anyone will really be able to answer that for me.

It's a great class and I really enjoy it. There's a bit more about the SI model on its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_instruction).

So I'm taking SI for CSc 15 and my instructor (let's call him Joe) thinks that I have enough interpersonal skills and prior CSc knowledge to instruct the class next semester. He'll go on to instruct CSc 20 and then next semester we'll both move up to the next rung. There's still an application and interview process and there absolutely will be other applicants, but he says that a recommendation from the current instructor will far surpass the hurdle of me being a freshman. 

Assuming I get the job, how do I teach a class??? If you were to give a crash course to somebody who spent the last 13-or-so years being a student on teaching something like SI, what would you put in it? Bonus points if you've been an SI instructor before. I'm just super nervous, and the class won't even start until January",,77ywlg,,0,,false,1510464797,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/77ywlg/got_asked_to_teach_a_study_hallesque_class_next/,,,,,

How do I make myself marketable to local magnet schools and college prep (public) schools? What should I emphasize in my portfolio? Our goal with our kids was 2 years of growth, and they showed an average of 9 months last year (from -2 months to 2.3 years). My numbers were about the same as the excellent and experienced reading specialist, suggesting that showing effectiveness and skill through student achievement on tests might not work, even if I improve my techniques and stay on another year or two.
How do I set up my portfolio so that I'm marketable in the absence of impressive scores?

1508936500,teaching,ImpliedShrimpZ,self.teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/78nigo/10th_grader_here_and_i_want_to_give_teachers_my/,11,0,,,"10th grader here, and i want to give teachers my prespective and some tips.","I admire you all, teachers. I owe you my life. I have finally come to realize that you give me the best tools and you deserve the best. Here are some thoughts from an Israeli high schooler:
1) This is the most important thing. Do not EVER be lighthanded with punishment and consequences. Punishments are there to help the students go back to the high road. With that said, don't make unreasonable ones. I once was gave a 2 day detention for borrowing a friend's pen and forgetting to return it until the next day. If a student cheats on a test, give a 0 without asking questions. I once did and received a 0 and I thank the teacher who did it up to this day.
2) This is mainly for mid to early elementary, but don't be afraid to make the learning as grand as possible. Students will remember much better if the material was given in a special, funny, new or even cringey way. You might get some malicious laughter but the students will remember the material much more.
3) Teach things that they don't get examed on. Up to you to inform them they won't get examed on or not, but school (ESPECIALLY elementary) is for knowing things for the future.
4) Don't hold back scolding a student in front of class. Getting told off in front of class is not nice- they won't want to get scolded again so they will behave. That said, don't go too far. I'll give an example. One year ago, first year highschool 9th grade, I was still (and still am) into Pokemon. During math class (which I were very involved in) I scribbled a list of nickname ideas for my new evolved Charizard. My teacher caught me red handed and read it in front of the class. I was bullied into moving classes. 
5) Very specific but is the worst feeling. Neither in public nor in person, don't tell a student their parents would be disappointed in them. Especially, and very especially, not ones who passed away. I lost my father to suicide and my teacher in elements always told me my father would be disappointed in me. Trust me, I felt like a peice of stepped-on manure. Just don't do that. Ever. E. V. E. R.
6) Don't give in to your students. My chemistry teacher always just backs down to students who want to leave or cancel the test and I suffer. Students don't appreciate school enough but don't give up. Just don't.
7) Related to six, don't ever admit wrong or apologize to a bad student (not grade-wise but behavior-wise). Rude student shouldn't get the feeling of being right and will use it against you always. Show power and just move on.
8) Help students who don't understand the material no matter how little they know it, as soon as possible. It will only get worse overtime to the point where it's not salvageable. Don't give up on anyone and more importantly, don't let them give up on theirselves. An answer to ""I don't understand this and I can't do it"" is ""let me help you understand so you can succeed.
9) EVERY. DIFFERENT. CLASS. MATTERS. The sentence i hear by fellow students all the time is ""Math/Physics/chem/history is not important to my life"". It always is. Knowledge is power. If you hear that, contact the teacher of that subject and tell them that the student needs help with it.
10) Consequences consequences consequences. Prioritize nice students over rude students with help on class but help the rude ones too. Don't inform students about all the consequences they will get from an action because being good isn't about avoiding consequences. Don't be light handed and always issue the biggest punishment allowed.
Bonus little thing, don't call students by their last name. My full name is Arad Gepner and getting adressed to as ""Gepner"" is the flipping worst. Unless you're a gym teacher, in that case ask the students what they prefer, because some prefer the authentic professional-sportsman feel of being called their last name.

Those were 11 tips by an Israeli 10th grader. Those are what I feel will build a teacher that will make kids smart and disciplined. Don't take anything here as rude. If you want to respond, address me as Arad and I will respond.

I just moved to a new state and my dream is to be an art teacher. When I interviewed for this job, I was told that this is an ""arts integration"" school, and that I would be free to incorporate art into all of their curriculum. I was also told that my class size would be around 12 students. It's important to note that I do not have a degree in teaching, I thought it was strange that it isn't a requirement in this state, but I figured I would go for it anyway. My degree is in fine art and I have minimal experience teaching painting classes.

After my first week, the other second grade teacher got fired and I had to take all of her students, bringing my roster to 25. Now that I'm knee deep into this school year, I've quickly realized that the ""arts integration"" was false advertising and I'm barely doing anything involving art with them. On top of it, many of my students are WAY below reading level, have IEPs, and major behavior problems (this is a Title I school). 

My students WILL NOT STOP TALKING. I cannot make it through any lesson without someone chatting, clicking, humming, clapping, stomping, etc. all day every day. They do not respect me. They do not respect each other. They're constantly arguing, tattling, stealing, and even putting their hands on each other. I've tried rewarding positive behavior, sitting them down and having a talk with them, sending them to the principal, sending notes home to parents. Nothing is working. I hate coming in to work every day. I'm so behind, all the time. I come in early and stay late AND come in on Sundays and it's still not enough. I'm barely getting any help. I feel like they haven't learned a thing. I don't know what to do.

-go back to the US and start teaching in Mass, worry about the initial licensure later

-start teaching and start a masters in education with initial licensure at UMASS Boston after teaching for a bit (within the 5 years)

-start teaching and do a grad certificate in initial licensure at UMASS Boston, but not a complete masters (I would love to do a masters at Middlebury in Spanish, so only doing the certificate to save a bit of money and time, but is that dumb to just not complete it as a masters???)

-start teaching with a fellowship, Boston Teaching Residency, Boston Teach Next Year. I already have experience teaching in the classroom and I know I like it but these seem like goo programs to prepare you, but I have to start making money already...

What is it like in other states??,"This is my first year teaching in North Carolina and I have learned more than I could have ever imagined. Before I begin, you need to know I love teaching and I could not picture myself doing anything else. Long story short I went to college in Massachusetts--&gt; fast forward four years and I took my first teaching job in NC. 

Let me tell you something, North Carolina is in the top 5 worst states to teach for a reason. First, do I love my kids? Yes, I can't imagine starting my career with any one else. Have I learned what I want in a school system and what I don't want? Hell yes. 

I don't think people truly understand the differences there are in the education systems throughout the states. Let's begin by discussing how my day is spent. I have 21 kindergarteners (5-6 year olds) with a teaching assistant about two hours a day. I eat my lunch with my kids and go out to recess with them everyday, meaning I get a total of 45 minutes to prep for my day/week (kids are at specials). Let me break that 45 minutes down for you: 5 minutes- walking the kids down to their special. 5 minutes- walking back to my class and stopping at the bathroom (it's the only chance I get all day), 5 minutes- prep for the last half of my day, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday 25 minutes- meeting with my team in another class to discuss data, update on kids, talk about plans etc. Thursday and Friday 25 minutes- prepping for the afternoon and trying to catch up on half the other shit, last 5 minutes- go pick up the kids.

Let’s compare this to Massachusetts (this is not all public schools in MA but many have similar schedules). A kindergarten teacher has anywhere from 16-20 kids in a class, they also have a full time assistant in the class the entire day. A kindergarten teacher typically has a 30-minute lunch break without the kids, a 45-minute prep period (kids are in specials and the teacher has to meet with their team in a different class once a week), and they have to go out to recess every other day (the other days they get to use as prep). 

These sounds like small things, but eating lunch with 20 five year olds gets tiring because they can’t walk in the line on their own, they are unable to open half the things they get, and they continuously need something (so this gives me about 10 minutes to eat my lunch). I’m ok because it is my first year, but I’m not sure how people can do it for 20+ years. 
So, now that I’ve rambled on and complained, what is it like in other states??

However, I want to leave the area. **Because of this, I am exploring possibilities worldwide, and I'd love to gain some insight into how other education systems differ from the one in which I have been trained and certified.**

Canadian schools are extremely ""liberal"" in their methods - teachers have complete control over what will happen in their classroom without approval from administration, learning is more focused on overall development of the child rather than earning letter and number grades until grade eight (age 13) or later, and the atmosphere in a classroom on the West Coast is very self-paced; that is, if the class excels in one area, they can move on and devote extra time to an area that they need more work in. Mathematics now has its foundations in DBL with almost total elimination of rote memorization, and social studies (involving history, current events, and politics) is focused primarily on local indigenous (native) education with no introduction to the outside world until grades 5-6 (ages 10-12). 

I am not in any way saying that I agree philosophically these things, but these are what I understand to be the ""quirks"" of the education system that I'm brought up in and that I have been trained to teach in. **With these things in mind, how does the UK education system differ from or resemble the Canadian (BC) system?** I'm aware of international teaching opportunities in other place, particularly in Canadian curriculum schools in China, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and so on.

Just thought I'd pass this along. I taught for the last few years abroad in Turkey, and loved it, but since I've moved back to Canada I've been focusing on my freelance writing career. I missed teaching though, and recently started teaching with VIP KID back in December, and I've actually really enjoyed it. I thought maybe some fellow teachers might as well.

In short, you teach kids in China English in 25 minute class segments. You get paid per hour, so essentially every 2 classes that you're booked for. The popular hours are essentially 5-9am Eastern time, and I usually teach 4-5 classes a morning before moving on to my freelance writing and all that. But you can also teach on weekends and that - basically just when kids aren't at school, so apparently the summer is great for work.

Anyway, based on your experience and interview, you get paid 14-22 bucks USD per hour, plus there's a load of incentives. Basically, you get extra money for every kid you teach, plus there are tiers. So if I teach over 44 classes per month, I get an extra dollar per class and so on and so forth.

As a male, I've also found that male teachers are pretty high in demand. Anyway, I figured I'd post here and you can feel free to ask questions.

My ASL classroom is changing over from traditional seating to flexible seating and we are SO excited! Just the idea of it has already boosted the engagement and morale of my kids, especially my Special Needs kids. However, almost everything that we are changing to must be purchased new, so I'm going to be straight with you guys...we need money! We are starting with $0, but our high school has set up a foundation account for our classroom so that donations can be made ONLINE via PayPal or credit/debit card and are 100% tax deductible! There are many amazing worthy educational causes out there and I am happy if all you can do is share this post, but if you can also find it in your heart to make a donation to our classroom, any amount you want, my 200+ students and I would be absolutely THRILLED and so very THANKFUL!! ��

You can donate here: https://www.tvgbf.com/donate/

For the first month or so I was just like ""it must be something to do with my work"" so I kept fixing it and sending it back to him. Everytime I did he came up with another part of the assignment that we weren't given. 
When me and a friend confronted him about this he told me to print the work out again and he would accept it then but when I went back to the computer he literally ran out of the class and to his car.
Now every day I argue with him and he has started saying that he never gave me those extra problems but me and about 5 others walked up to his desk and confronted him about it again because they all heard him say it and he couldn't do anything.
He still won't accept my work and just for a bit of classwork me and a friend copied each other word for word I gave mine up first and he sent it back and my friend went up 30 mins later with the exact same work and accepted it. 
We have talked to everyone we possibly can and when he gets confronted by his bosses in our class he says that we are all lying and they don't believe us.
Is there really anything we can do about this tips would be appreciated.
Also I got a few people's from class work and am now taking their best parts from their work and 'improving' mine with it.

My first year ended on an extremely high note - I got the highest scores in the whole school, my principal was very happy with me, praised my management etc etc. I decided to stay another year because it was job security and I felt respected at the school. This year we have a new AP who is extremely critical, nitpicky, biased and unfair. She has made the life of pretty much every K-5 teacher hell with unfair low evaluations, making very demeaning, antagonizing comments, and criticizing everything we do but without advice/feedback on how to improve. She has weekly meetings set up with me during my prep but she literally never shows up to these meetings. She told me I need to print out all of my testing and AR data every week with these meetings, yet she never shows up to them. Then gives me low ratings for professionalism in my quarterly evaluation rubric. We've had ""data"" meetings with the principal which she has sat in on and told me ""just because your students are quiet doesn't mean they're engaged"". Then didn't offer ANY ways on how to get them more engaged. The principal just sat there silently watching it all, so I don't think explaining all of this to him will do anything. She told me I need to give way more homework so I did. Yesterday a kid peed in his pants, and the father called the school and he cursed me out about the pants peeing and about the homework. The kid's parents met with the AP because they were extremely pissed and wanted to transfer him... and afterwards she told me they said the kid hates life/school because of me (this kid does NOTHING ALL DAY, other than drawing and playing with pens - sure I've disciplined him but nothing extreme. The mom has always been very polite/nice to me and complained about the homework...I explained the situation to her and she left very positively). The AP, after meeting the parents. told me I need to watch my tone with kids and also got angry about the homework situation at me (another parent complained about more homework too - it was literally 5 pages). I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel depressed, anxious, stressed, helpless...I want to quit teaching for good.

I have been teaching preschool through 4th grade. I would love to hear some pros and cons from people who have taught both groups of people. For context, I am hoping to be a teacher at a bilingual school (Spanish/English).

What I currently like about primary:
- The kids are always excited to learn 
- They don't have an attitude yet
- I can be more creative with arts and crafts and projects
- I feel that I am making a huge impact since they aren't fully formed in how they are yet 

What I currently don't like about primary:
- I can't really teach in depth about subjects or have deeper conversations
- The parents are so overly involved sometimes and can be very pushy and tell you how to do your job
- There's no denying that the pay isn't great and early childhood educators don't get a lot of respect in general (which is a shame)
- There's no real school community (at a high school I really think that I'd love to coach a sport or just be a part of a the school spirit and community of a high school)
- It's hard to connect with students on a personal level

So wanted to give some background, I am from India and over the past couple of months have been working with a bunch of kids from a local community. They are a mixture of 4th to 8th graders, who come from a low-income background, and many have extremely difficult home-situations - but nevertheless they have a zeal and spark to learn:) 

I have been working with them through an after-school program to help improve their academic levels, as unfortunately the standards in the local government school is extremely poor. 

I am focusing on improving their numeracy and mathematical understanding. Almost all the kids are way behind their grade-level requirements, and I am planning to start from scratch. 
Unfortunately, most of the Indian school textbooks focus on computation and procedures of solving a problem without delving into the conceptual understanding of the topic. 

Through my online research I came across this Canadian website called Jump Math which has loads of teaching material - which I am currently planning to incorporate in my lesson plans for the kids. 


I am reaching out to ask you all if you could guide me to any other websites/resources that you would recommend for me to use?

Any references and suggestions would be really helpful!

Sorry if this doesn't really belong here, but I'm kinda stuck and looking for advice.

 A little Background;

I have a BA in International Development and an MA in Creative Media. I recently left the British Army at the rank of Captain. I also have a TEFL and a CELTA. Before I joined the Army I was teaching ESL at a Japanese Highschool and Im currently teaching a variety of things, (mostly ESL related, often also History and Public Speaking) in Beijing. I never really set out to be a teacher, but just sort of fell back on to it. It turns out, that surprisingly (to me at least) Im actually quite good at it. My students all like me and in my company i am the most requested teacher by both students and parents. 

Im not making bad money at the moment, but I am starting to think that maybe I should consider becoming a 'Real' teacher. I would like to stay in China, Ideally, I would love to teach at one of the big international schools here. 

The thing is, though I really don't want to be teaching ESL, I have no idea what I can actually teach.

As much as I like teaching high school students, I don't really have a subject. My Degrees are not really in any subject that is taught in most High Schools (Media Studies is a possibility, but that's not really a thing in China). 

The other issue is my Age. Ill be 33 this year. Although most people look at me and guess late 20's, Im pretty sure I'm in the higher end of the bell curve for NQTs. 

Not really sure that I have any specific question, but would appreciate any advice from teachers here. 

TLDR: I like teaching High school kids, but I don't really have a defined subject I am qualified to teach. What do?

The teacher will give him directions like ""get up"" the student won't listen and the teacher gives up. 

Well today he started to hit me if I walked by him, which I have to do to get to other students. I can't ignore that, because if I do it's teaching him it's okay to act like this. 

I have no idea what to do. It's not my room and the teacher backs down and tells the aids to ignore him as well and he will eventually stop... He carried on for over 1.5 hrs. 

He loves animals. I made him an animal sheet for what he was suppose to be working on. He ripped it up because his pencil didn't have an eraser and was chewed on... by him.

I am a uOttawa alumnus (25F) completing a second degree in 2019, after which I will be applying to th bED program. I have volunteered in Grade 3-5 classrooms and after-school tutoring programs. I have also done in-class support for Grades 9 through 12 (French, English and early Sciences) and have tutored French at the university level.

My issue is that, while I am certain I do not want to apply to the P/J division, I am not sure if I would be of a better fit in a J/I or an I/S context. For context:

1. In the J/I division, I would choose French as a teachable (French Immersion is my goal in this division)
2. In the I/S division, I would choose French as a my primary teachable, coupled with either English or History. I have a background in Geography, but I am unable to pair it with French due to new and flabbergasting university restrictions.
3. My undergraduate degrees mainly focused on French (linguistics and literature), Geography (mostly physical), Second Language Teaching and Psychology, with additional credits in History
4. In my Second Language Teaching courses, I have noticed that my course plans are sequential and elaborate, using technologies, creativity and critical thinking skills to demonstrate understanding. The expectations are beyond what the P/J division would be able to handle. I am *thinking* that Grade 8/9 on average would be the best fit, but both divisions cover these years, and the OTC has yet to inform me as to whether J/I or I/S is in higher demand in terms of fluent French teachers irrelevant of schoolboard
5. Through volunteering, I have discovered a soft spot for my fourth graders, which would be covered by J/I. Reflecting on a certain long-term experience volunteering in Grade 9 Core French classroom, I am also concerned that I will not have enough of an authoritative presence to control adolescent students, although they would be at a sufficient level of cognitive development to tackle some of my more sophisticated ideas
6. I plan on teaching in urban Ontario and, eventually (see: a decade from now), coastal BC

From here, I'm not sure where to go, and I begin applying at the end of the summer. I am thinking of trying to find a placement in a Grade 7-9 classroom, but this would be for the Fall, and my applications will be submitted by then meaning I can't use that experience to make a judgment call.

I therefore ask: from your experiences as educators, what are some of the main things to consider about J/I and I/S division that may or may not be obvious to someone in my position, having not been professionally involved in such a setting? What are some elements you have discovered that might ""make or break"" the decision? What are your experiences in terms of course planning and establishing rapport with other staff members and, of course, students in your division? What character traits stand out as essential for an educator to have in your division? Do you have any idea as to the difference in ""marketability"" between being qualified at the J/I vs the I/S division?

Hi everyone! Apologies for the long post 

I’ve recently decided to take on elementary teaching after subbing for 1.5 years because of the close bonds I have created with teachers and their encouragement in me. One reason being that I have gained very close relationships with a great majority of teachers at a school I love (I actually went their as a child) however I am still waiting on a decision from them to hire me. After interviewing with them on literally the last day of school they told me that right now they don’t know what teachers are staying going/ budget and can’t get me a definite answer and pretty much said I was kind of waitlisted? I would really love working at this school because I feel confident already with working with all the staff and they know and care about me already so well and the school is actually only a few minutes from my house.
   However, I was recently offered a position at a Charter school from this amazing principal who seems wonderful to work under. He was extremely friendly and he expressed that he believed in me and I’d do great there! He even asked me what grade I wanted and offered the grade on the spot. I would start as a permanent substitute and when my statement of eligibility would come in I’d be a teacher and my pay would increase. I’d also like to mention that the pay here just as a perm sub would be the same amount I would be paid pretty much as a full time teacher at the public school; it would then increase to making more than the public school but just by +2,000 salary increase. This school is actually very close also to where I live ( 6 minute drive)

I’m stuck in a pickle because I don’t know whether to commit to the charter school or hold out and wait for a position on my dream school. I really would love working at the school where I’m comfortable with the staff however it’s not guaranteed and It isn’t guaranteed I’d get the grade range I would like (2nd-4th). The public school also has a new principal this year and I know that can cause chaos and tension with the staff

This is my first time posting here, could you guys give me advice and opinions on working for charter schools vs public schools? Thank you ",,8unknf,,0,,false,1536458018,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/8unknf/cant_decide_in_taking_a_job_at_a_charter_school/,,,false,,

I've been teaching for about two years now and I believe I've reached stage 4 on this list: (http://www.15minutes4me.com/burnout-free/burnout-stress-depression-anxiety-what-is-the-difference/) 

I adore teaching itself and I adore the kids but the workload, sleep deprivation, staff politics, and 9 hour daily barrage of social interactions 5 times a week has caused me to crash. I have, as a result, decided to complete this term and then take a break from teaching in order to recuperate and give myself space to think.

Has anyone else been through this? How did you ""bounce back"" from the burn out? Do you think that if I've reached this stage after only 2 years, that it's a sign that teaching is not for me? 

I'd really appreciate some advice on the matter from some fellow teachers - thank you in advance.

Edit: Thank you all for your replies. I've considered your words and thought a lot about my decision.

When I was in high school my classes didn't have this at all. We had some basic decorations, but nothing like I see online. But the online classrooms that I see are full of all kinds of exciting colorful stuff. 

I'm wondering if that's normal for high school classrooms though? My classrooms were never more than a few posters and minimal decorations during high school. Is this a new thing?

I'm planning to decorate some, I like posters and want to put useful information around for the students to use. I'm an artist so I may put up some of my paintings and I will probably bring one of my guitars to hang on the wall (for students to use if they want to learn, it's why I bought the guitar).

I also would like address the light issue. Fluorescent lights suck but I'm not sure what to do about them. I found blue light coverings on amazon that I would like to try if I'm allowed. So wondering what others have done. (My room doesn't have windows)

(I am feeling very very very self-conscious about my green-horned idealism, so please read this generously and without judgement.) 

I took a job teaching 6th grade ELA/Social Studies at a really high-need school and I am starting to regret it... a lot... even though I haven't even started. Whenever I say the name of the school to anyone in education, I can see their faces drop. I hear it's just *the worst* school. Personally, I feel terrible calling schools bad or bringing in my value judgments--because I honestly and fundamentally believe that kids aren't bad and teachers aren't bad and everyone has good intentions!-- but it is ranked 37/37 for overall quality in the district... the proficiency scores on standardized tests hover at around the 2% mark, and it is physically connected to one of the most violent high school in the city.

When I went into the interview, I went in not even wanting the job because I saw all the data and knew I did not want to be in a school like that. I thought it would just be a practice interview because I had a few promising ones lined up afterwards. But... I was really charmed by how clean and bright the school was and how caring and patient the staff seemed. I went in during the day and there were no students wandering the halls... they were in class and on-task. Anyway, I did a really good job at this practice interview, and they hired me on the spot. 

I recently completed a Masters Degree in Middle School education so I know I am *technically* qualified. Plus, I am really empathetic, community oriented, and culturally competent. I have even started getting involved with community groups surrounding the school. I am very very aware of the trauma that many of my future students will be coming to school with, and I know that classroom management will be my biggest hurdle. I also know that organization will be a challenge, so I have already begun planning entire units--incorporating all the state standards, of course!--as to not be overwhelmed at the beginning of the year. I know all of these things, and I know that this self-awareness and capacity for self-reflection makes me qualified to be a teacher at a school like this.. but I am concerned about so many other things.

The first thing is, of course, testing. Not only are the scores so low, but the school has a very, very low enrollment because many families choose to send their children to charter schools. It is a 5-8 school with the capacity for 1,600 kids. There are under 400 students enrolled. I have heard rumors of it being potentially shut down because of this, which adds extra pressure to raise standardized test scores. I can tell everyone is extremely frantic about this, which is causing me a lot of anxiety because *I don't know what I am doing.* I also know that I am going to bite the bullet and have to rely on the textbook, which I really, really, really don't want to do because the textbook kinda stinks. But mostly, I am concerned about the pressures of testing and knowing that I will feel like a total failure because I am being set up to fail.

The second thing is: the first day. What is the best possible first day activity?

The third thing is: how do you handle bad behavior the first week? The school has a PBIS team, but I am not fully versed on it. Plus, I was hoping to create a classroom contract/constitution at the beginning of the year.. but what happens when there is a disruption before that starts--which there inevitably will be! What are some tools people use to draw students back in during a teacher-centered lesson when relationships haven't been cultivated? When I student taught, my cooperating teacher didn't really have any classroom management issues. On the off chance she did, she just screamed at kids, which made me feel kind of shitty.

The fourth thing is: does anyone have any recommendations for trauma informed pedagogy, particularly in the middle grades?

The fifth thing is: what the hell do 6th graders like? What kind of music do they listen to? When I student taught, I only had one class of 6th graders. I totally adored them, but I couldn't manage to gauge what they were into the way I could with the 7th and 8th graders. I know it's important to get to know kids when the year starts, but I'd like to be as prepared as possible, ya know? And, also: what types of things can be used as prizes and rewards?

Ok. Thanks a lot for any and all feedback. Mostly, I just really, really don't want to do these kids a disservice next year or let anyone down. I have a tendency to fuck up, but I care so much about education that I want to ~set myself up for success~~~~.",,6npsih,,0,,false,1502111145,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/6npsih/first_year_at_a_high_need_school_some_questionsa/,,,false,,

I've been stuck on getting him past this level - he knows a few sight words now after some work and I've been trying to help him with long/short vowels but it feels like I've hit a roadblock and he's progressing slowly. I pick books that he can read with picture contexts and sight words he does know. However he seems to lose interest very quickly with these and always wants to do something else.

What are some ways you've used to engage students like this? I've done games (bingo, snakes and ladders, memory games), we do coloring worksheets, I read a children's book and sometimes ask him to identify the sight words in them... he just seems to want to do something else. He brought in a math workbook once and seems to enjoy math much more and has a lot more initiative at trying to figure things out.

Any advice?,"Next week I'll be doing 5 different writing classes. The grade level is 5-8th grade, and every student is very new to English. They all have pretty limited vocabulary and weak grammar skills. Writing is hard enough in itself, but trying to force these ideas out of new learners sounds very difficult.

What skills should I focus on? They already have other classes that focus on reading, grammar, vocabulary, and speaking skills. So besides the occasional grammar lesson, my place isn't really to sit there and teach them past/present verb structures or make them memorize long lists of words. My goal is to help them figure out how to form and organize their ideas and then put those ideas onto paper.

It's just the lesson plan part that concerns me. Here is an example topic for the 5th graders:

&gt;**Topic:** Tell me about a time that you had a problem that you solved. Talk about why your problem was a big issue and tell me how you solved your problem. Be sure to describe in details what you did do solve your problem, and how you life was better after you solved it.

&gt;**How To Write:** In this essay I want you use a lot of details and explain your problem and solution very well. 

&gt;•	First you need to say what your problem was and why it was such a problem. What was it doing to make your life bad?

&gt;•	Second you need to say how you thought of what to do. Did you look online? Did you ask a friend, parent or teacher?

&gt;•	Third you need to describe how you solved your problem. Go through and say all the steps you used to solve your problem.

&gt;•	Finally you need to say how you felt after your problem was solved.

&gt;Remember that you are using the **past tense** so you need to make sure all your verbs are in the past!

The expectation is for every student to have completed a one-paragraph essay after 3 weeks, and I need to be able to send home an outline, first draft, and final draft to the parents. It is one 40-minute class per week. 

So... I'm just not sure how to get them to start writing. I think they're going to have a lot of trouble and I'm not sure how to even approach these classes. What should I do?

First, this is a repost after 4 months. I have deleted the original post, but some may have taken this survey before. Please let me know if this is not allowed and I will delete the post.

&amp;nbsp;

Dear Sir or Madam, You are invited to participate in a research study for U.S. K-12 pre-service teachers entitled Investigation of COA-IIIA Score Reliability and Validity Among Pre-Service Teachers being conducted by Chris Kraner, a graduate student, and Todd Reeves, a faculty member, at Northern Illinois University. The purpose of the study is to examine the psychometric properties (reliability and validity) of the Conceptions of Assessment III—Abridged instrument among U.S. K-12 pre-service teachers.
 
&amp;nbsp;

The study will involve completion of an online survey about your beliefs about assessment, your beliefs about data, and your educational and demographic characteristics. The online survey should take about 15 minutes to complete. The information you individually provide will not be shared with the teacher preparation program in which you are enrolled. Participation requires that an individual is at least 18 years of age and is a U.S. K-12 pre-service teacher (i.e., enrolled in an accredited post-secondary instruction program leading to teacher licensure). If you choose to participate in the study, you will be able to enter into a drawing for 1 of 3 Amazon Echo Dots.
 
&amp;nbsp;

The survey and more information about the study can be accessed here: https://niu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0631uFi8q9jlFgF

&amp;nbsp;

We would be grateful if you would participate in our study, if you are eligible, or if you could disseminate the link to individuals who are eligible. The survey is best completed on a personal computer (e.g., laptop, desktop), rather than a mobile/cell phone
 
&amp;nbsp;

Thank you in advance for your participation.

Does anyone have any good tips for 18 year olds that want to be taught? Feel free to skip the rest and just chime in if it's easier.

People will be coming to drop in sessions and I'll be expected to work with small groups(1-4) on their issues with problem sheets and lectures.

They presented a situation to look at and work through to get to grips with the position (I'll make it shorter to spare you all the drudgery)

**Scenario:

Poppy and Tom are studying maths. Poppy finishes 3 questions but doesn't try Q4. She asks Tom who says he has only done Q1.

They come to the session and Poppy gets her books out and asks ""How do I do Q4? Are my answers right?"". Meanwhile Tom just sits there and does nothing.

Question

Describe how you would work with Poppy and Tom in this scenario. What would you definitely do and not do? What concerns might you have? What approaches and resources would you use? What do you aim to achieve before you need to talk to other students who are waiting?

My thoughts are that I would initially ask Poppy if she has any idea how to do question 4 and try and steer into the right position to have a go at the start of it, and tell Tom I'd be with him shortly.

Then I'd address Tom and see if I could get him started on Q2,3. If he finishes quickly I'd tell Poppy to stop and we could go through solutions.

Then ideally Tom and Poppy could then collaborate on Q4.

Do:Make both students feel involved, ensure neither is sitting about waiting for my help.

Not do:Give either Tom or Poppy the answers to the Qs before the other had started, as this would defeat the point of the exercise.

Concerns:Tom doesn't seem very motivated and might not get to Q4 in time for us to finish. If I'm short on time I should prioritise Poppy as she's clearly more motivated.

Approaches/Resources: I could ask Poopy to explain questions 2/3 to Tom if I'm short on time after checking to make sure her method is right. I could potentially use some computer stuff to illustrate but I'm not sure how relevant that would be.

Aims: Ideally they should be in a situation to approach all the questions if they combine their knowledge i.e poppy should be able to assist Tom without 2,3 and they should be able to start Q4.",,6vv3ag,,0,,false,1504720914,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/6vv3ag/helptips_teaching_small_groups_of_first_year_uni/,,,,,

I'm 25, and have genuinely loved teaching/helping others learn new things for as long as I can remember. However, due to reasons, my career took my down a different path. For further reasons, that career is now as dead in the water as its possible to be. 

So I'm now doing something different, but I know two things. 

First, it's fairly 'end of the road' already, with little prospect for getting any further. It's IT, for those interested. IT is one of my 'things,' as it were, alongside a long background in aviation. 

Second, even if it were not 'end of the road,' the cost and time needed to get to a level where I could legitimately step up some levels are both highly time consuming and hideously expensive. 

Could I do it? Yes. Could I do it doing my current career? Also yes, but I also need to face facts and know that I'm definitely not happy.

Hello!
Let me start off by saying that I am not a teacher. I work as an elementary PE instructional aide. My team consists of three people: the actual PE teacher, and two aides. We rotate between 4 schools throughout the week grades TK-5. I work in a fairly small district out in the country, but I see about 1500 different children each week. Most of the schools have 3-4 classes per grade, so I have anywhere from about 20-35 children under my supervision at any given time. Each class is 55 minutes, and in that time each group will rotate between the three instructors, so I only see each child for 20 minutes tops.

As you can imagine, this makes it hard to get to know everyone and learn their names. We have no access to a gym at any school, so being outside there is usually a number of distractions: other children playing at recess, other PE groups that are nearby, large diesels driving by (one school is next to a road that leads to a big highway), loud farm equipment, etc. Because of these distractions, I often find myself having to yell so everyone can hear me (which is tiring in and of itself).

My biggest issue by far is getting children to quiet down and listen when I'm talking. Some groups are much better than others, but some groups just SUCK at it. I was with a group of ~35 2nd graders earlier, inside the classroom due to the extreme heat, and I could not get them to quiet down for the life of me. I tried the special clap sequence that the entire school knows, didn't work. I tried using a quiet voice to encourage them to be better listeners, didn't work. I tried counting down 3-2-1, didn't work. I tried having them work quietly at their desk, didn't work. Getting them to ""freeze"" was unsuccessful as well. It was so frustrating. Worse, their teacher (a sub, I think) was sitting at the desk the whole time and they were still acting like animals. It's barely the second week of PE class.

Educators of /r/teaching, what advice do you have in regards to classroom management for an instructor such as myself? I want my groups to have fun during our time together, but that can't happen if they can't shut up and listen.",,6wz4y0,,0,,false,1504741282,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/6wz4y0/ca_elementary_pe_instructor_classroom_management/,,,,,

Sometimes I need to do some test exams and I noticed it was quite boring and painful for students, also, managing and correcting them was quite a pain, so I created [rQuizzer](https://raysan5.itch.io/rquizzer).

rQuizzer is a simple and easy-to-use tool to create quizz tests for students in a secure and safe way. It also includes some gamification options to make the tests more challenging and less boring.

rQuizzer has been tested with around 150 students in 5 different subjects and it works very good! Most of the students love it... and some also hate it... :P

Usage is very simple, just editing a plain text file to configure the test, students registered for that test, questions and answers. That file is codified on first loading for later deploy to students and the tool also registers results and some useful data about students like time per question or global time for further analysis.

Features:

- Easily configurable with a plain text file
- Codified questions and answers file generation
- Any number of questions supported
- Up-to 4 possible answers by question
- Students list configurable in module file
- Student ID checking and verification
- Random questions order (random by ID)
- Random answers order (random by ID)
- Configurable quizz time (total time)
- Configurable question time (individual time)
- Configurable quizz validity (time span)
- Results (and additional data) exported codified
- Results viewer for review and stats analysis
- Completely portable (single file)
- Configurable visual style (on demand)
- Multiplatform (on demand)

rQuizzer has been created using [raylib](http://www.raylib.com/), a simple and easy to use library to learn videogames programming that I also created and I've been using for the last 4 years to teach videogames development basis.
 
Despite rQuizzer has been used for some time, it's still under development and new features are being added, what do you think? any feature you think could be useful?

Advice needed.","I'm one week into the new school year and I'm teaching Yr.5-8 English and Geography. My school is excellent and I really cannot fault it in any way, however I am incredibly stressed and anxious, can barely sleep at night and don't want to get out of bed in the mornings. It's not the Geography classes at all, in fact it was landing a job teaching Geography at this school earlier this year that reignited my spark for teaching. Before that I was teaching English, French and Humanities for four years in my home country and was driven to the brink of dropping out and became a statistic because I just couldn't handle the stresses that came with teaching English. There is a huge amount of pressure put on English teachers, I feel, as it is a core subject, and in the end I just couldn't stand the never ending marking and constant questioning from parents. Geography was a breath of fresh air and I found that I could get on with being a teacher and I was genuinely excited by all the topics and lessons I was teaching. Now here we are in September and unfortunately I've only got myself to blame for getting myself into this predicament as I can't and don't want to teach the English, and I'm hating myself for accepting the offer when it was made to me a few months ago. I am secondary trained and have only really taught upper high school English. I have no idea what I'm doing and I feel way out of my depth. I'm ashamed and embarrassed to have gotten myself into this situation and feel that it's unfair to continue with these students knowing I can't do them justice. Support is there, and I have asked a hundred questions and everyone has been very helpful, yet despite everyone's assistance and encouragement I personally have no drive for this subject. Already I don't care. I don't even want to try and understand how to teach a nine year old how to edit. It's terrible to say that, but it's the truth and I would rather quit and do supply teaching or (more desirably) something else altogether than push through the year ahead, especially as I only have 10 months left on my visa here and I don't want that time to be miserable. 
I spilled my thoughts to a colleague yesterday after work and I was a complete mess. It's very clear that I'm suffering from (undiagnosed) anxiety and need to deal with that. I have had a tight knot in my stomach for the last 12-18 months or so- varying degrees day to day- and I need to sort myself out and seek help. For my own sake I don't feel I can continue, especially with the English classes, and now need to book a meeting with my principal and let them know how I'm feeling as I don't want this to drag on. I'm fully aware this may very well mean that I will need to resign, although I'd happily continue to teach the Geography classes. I'm unsure what's going to happen going forward, but I was wondering if anyone out there has had a similar experience or could lend some advice?

This is my first full year teaching 11-12th grade high school physics (I came in halfway through last year as an intern), and I'm trying to create/find curriculum. I never really got much experience observing other teachers because I came in as an intern, so I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm starting to lean toward using worksheets fairly often in my class, since physics is one of those subjects where students need a lot of practice problems. I feel like a terrible teacher for giving out worksheets though. I can't really think of good alternative to teach them the content though. I am currently handing out about 2 worksheets per week, and feel guilty. 

Here's my typical week (with warm-ups/exit tickets daily):
Day 1 - Notes, and then a worksheet to review and practice the content from the notes.
Day 2 (block period) - Lab to practice the content from Day 1.
Day 3 - Finish Lab, start a reading/more notes, another worksheet.
Day 4 - Review content, or some other activity.
Also: I rarely assign homework, and want to keep it that way.

For more reference, I'm sticking to the worksheets from physicsclassroom.com, e.g.:
http://www.physicsclassroom.com/curriculum/1Dkin/Describing-Motion-Speed-and-Velocity 
Which conveniently have corresponding readings if students get stuck on them.

My class' background: I work in a pretty high cost of living area, and teach 2 levels of physics. The class in question is similar to an honors level class; all the students are highly motivated, and will do pretty much anything I tell them. They also respond well to challenging material. However, I do have some students in the class that are already starting to struggle with the content. I like how my class is going so far, but I feel like I'm going to be judged by my peers and administration for relying on worksheets/notes a bunch.

Is this amount of worksheets ok? What are some alternatives for teaching physics?

TL;DR: I use about 2 worksheets/worksheet packets a week in honors level physics class, usually based on ~15-30 minute note taking sessions. I feel like a bad teacher doing this. I already feel judged by my supervising mentor teacher (who has never taught physics).

I had a pretty terrible experience, and realized during that time teaching might not be my long term career goal. Right now, it's more of a way to begin building my resume and working towards another avenue in education.

I ended up working for a community college last year and loved it, but was laid off in The early spring because enrollment was down. I knew I needed to find a stable position and continue gaining experience teaching in order to open doors and opportunities outside of classroom teaching. Plus, I want to start saving and paying back my student loans. So, I decided to take another stab at classroom teaching. 

I love working with students, I love my school, and I love my administration. But, I hate being in the classroom. There is just so much pressure on teachers today. When I am not at the school, I am working on lesson planning and grading. When I'm not doing that, I am thinking about work/ways to improve my abilities. 

I know the first year is hard. I know it gets easier. But I also know my heart isn't in this for the long haul. Please know that doesn't mean I am not going to give it my all and work my butt off to grow and become a great teacher (and that I also may very well change my mind). 

I'd like to begin working towards getting my MA+45 and looking at adding endorsements that could help me stay in education in an avenue that isn't necessarily teaching in the classroom.

I'd love to hear about what other options there might be for me in education that isn't classroom teaching. I am looking at seeing if there may be an opportunity for me being a media specialist. But what other options and opportunities might be out there for me to look into? How (and when) should I bring this up to my supervisor? 

Thanks for your thoughts! If you also have any suggestsions on balancing work and life, that would be so appreciated.

Which other tools do you sign up for and what are your criteria for selection? Do your students have ipads in the classroom or are they using a few computers?

UPDATE: Since the original post, the content has gone completely free! (No more trial period)
I have created a series of online games which can be used for any subject matter. They also don't require a 1-1 device for the students to play, only a projector. The goal is to make the review of content more fun! The biggest differentiator from other games out there is that there is strategy required to win in addition to answering correctly. I'm really hoping that I'm not violating the subreddit rules as it is not monetized, but I'm looking for a few teachers to try out the games and give me some feedback.

I'm still very much a noob as I teach at a school where my race is a minority (I'm white btw) and a good handful of behavior problem kids are in each class. 
I've been having issues maintaining my classes. My students refuse to listen to me and will do what they want and many will refuse to work or half ass their projects cuz they don't care. Many are very disrespectful to me. I've asked for help from admin. They wanted me to reach out to a nearby school to observe how they do art classes (I'm an art teacher and have the kids twice a week for 30mins each). The teacher never replied of course. I'm
not surprised she was my supposed mentor in my first year who did nothing for me.
No other attempts have been made to help me by admin though I've asked. I have split classes aka a class and a half upwards of 30 kids for several of my blocks with no support unless I call for a dean which is sporadic. Of course fights and other behavior erupts and I get blamed by admin, kids, and parents alike. It's my fault of course. I've actually told an AP I don't feel like I'm being supported only for her to tell me I was wrong and I am! She totally invalidated everything I said and made me feel small. 
It got to the point I asked my district boss to help. She and another district person are coming for a block tomorrow which is great. However admin mostly my principal is no help. He's terrible though no one at my school (including my mom who works in the office) thinks so as people think he's the next education Jesus or something. He's very hands off lets things do its thing but hands on for dumb things. 
Like today he came in my room to scold me for having pastel marks on the floor last Friday. Apparently the custodians complained though it's their job to clean and the class that made the mess is one I've been asking for help. And I can't clean the classroom and do carline duty at the same time after school. 
I told principal this and he said nothing other than make sure the kids clean up after themselves.  He then came in my room about three times throughout the day to shout at the kids to clean up. I'm like wtf. You put this much energy in this but not my needs??
Anyways, it's getting to the point I want to leave. Transfer, quit teaching, something. I'm depressed and sometimes think of harming myself since obviously I'm a shit teacher since no one cares about me at my school. I'm also bringing this mood into my classroom which makes me sad; I snap at the kids cuz Im stressed and it makes me feel even worse. I need help asap. Where can I start?

All advice is appreciated.,"All names are fake. I live and work in New Zealand (second year teaching), and the class is 7/8 years old. Both are very academically intelligent, but Kimmy is much more socially intelligent.

So, Samantha and Kimmy are having trouble. At the start of the year, they were two parts of a clique of five girls, who have splintered into Samantha/Kimmy, Lucy/Emily, and Amanda can hang out with either, all, or others.

Samantha has become a social pariah in the class as a whole. She has been abrasive and stand-offish, and people realised that becoming her friend wasn't really worth the effort. Kimmy still tries, but finds herself excluded from the class when with Samantha. Amanda tries less frequently, for the same reason. 

Kimmy doesn't want to stop being Samantha's friend because she knows she's almost Samantha's last chance to have a good friend, but when they have issues, Samantha goes back to her old abrasive ways and pushes her away. If anyone else shows her friendship, she clings, since she gets so little of it.

If there were no backstory, there would be no trouble. The issue is mostly with the social stigma around Samantha.

I've seen this happen before. It ruined the poor kid's social life for the entire year, and possibly beyond. The experienced teacher I was working with at the time had tried roughly a thousand fixes with no luck - mostly social coaching.

My main question is this; what are they main things I need to be doing when modelling to younger children? How does it differ from older children?

&amp;nbsp;

First, this is a third and final attempt at recruitment after another 2 months have passed. I have deleted the original post, but some may have taken this survey before. Please let me know if this is not allowed and I will delete the post.

&amp;nbsp;

Dear Sir or Madam,

&amp;nbsp;

You are invited to participate in a research study for U.S. K-12 pre-service teachers entitled Investigation of COA-IIIA Score Reliability and Validity Among Pre-Service Teachers being conducted by Chris Kraner, a graduate student, and Todd Reeves, a faculty member, at Northern Illinois University. The purpose of the study is to examine the psychometric properties (reliability and validity) of the Conceptions of Assessment III—Abridged instrument among U.S. K-12 pre-service teachers.

&amp;nbsp;

The study will involve completion of an online survey about your beliefs about assessment, your beliefs about data, and your educational and demographic characteristics. The online survey should take about 15 minutes to complete. The information you individually provide will not be shared with the teacher preparation program in which you are enrolled.

&amp;nbsp;

Participation requires that an individual is at least 18 years of age and is a U.S. K-12 pre-service teacher (i.e., enrolled in an accredited post-secondary instruction program leading to teacher licensure). If you choose to participate in the study, you will be able to enter into a drawing for 1 of 3 Amazon Echo Dots.

&amp;nbsp;

The survey and more information about the study can be accessed here: https://niu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_73ukcnLJq549rEx We would be grateful if you would participate in our study, if you are eligible, or if you could disseminate the link to individuals who are eligible. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The survey is best completed on a personal computer (e.g., laptop, desktop), rather than a mobile/cell phone**

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you in advance for your participation. 

&amp;nbsp;

Sincerely,

Chris Kraner

It's making me second guess my decision to become a teacher because teaching is nothing like what I thought it would be. I decided to pursue teaching because I wanted to make a difference in students' lives and also wanted to get the proper credentials to be able to teach abroad. Now I am not so sure about this decision because I don't enjoy teaching here, so I am wondering if I would even like teaching abroad. 

Anyone who has made the transition to teaching abroad and didn't necessarily *enjoy* teaching in the States, was your transition better? Do you enjoy teaching abroad more than you did in the States? What advice do you have for me?

The kid has stated too the aid that he wanted too go too the roof, and one day when he stated this the aid asked why. The kid replied "" i want too kill myself so i can be happy because my mommy doesn't love me"". The school itself is having all kinds of issues trying too keep the child under wraps so to speak. The aid did not report it originally due too the child only being 4 years old and not really thinking that the kid understood what he was speaking about. The aid does not want to lose his job however at this point he is sure that a large portion of the problems are stemming from the home. What should he do?

I'm becoming pretty dissatisfied with the job for multiple reasons: pay is poor (24k), it's a 45 minute commute, my boss seems kind of mentally unstable, and in general I'm not satisfied by this work. 

Anyways, I have an MFA in Poetry and a bachelor's in English. During my MFA program I had a teaching assistantship, and in general I loved it. I taught several english literature survey courses as a TA and then several creative writing classes as instructor on record. It was a blast. 

So I would really like to get back into teaching I think, but as we all know, teaching in higher ed these days is pretty brutal, with the adjunct crisis and all. So I'm contemplating other teaching options. I'm curious, how many of you have made the transition from higher ed to high school or elementary education? Vice versa? I guess I'm just looking for some general advice. What was your experience? I'm 28, and completed my MFA a year and a half ago.

I will give a description of us and what kind of experience we are looking for. I’m a bit lost when looking online, unsure of what is legit and reputable and all that stuff, so hopefully I can gain some insight from real teachers on here. 

First off, I am a 25 year old female who has been credited in Canada to teach elementary education. I am bilingual (French and English), and am currently in my second year of teaching. I teach music P-9, grade 7 Social Studies, and grade 6 ELA. 

 I am married to a 38 year old professional musician who has toured the world in the Celtic genre. He has also landscaped and driven limousines and done an assortment of jobs. He does not possess a degree. Together we have a two year old. Both the toddler and husband have their British passports. 

We are currently living in a town that is so small that my husband cannot do what he is best at: teaching his instrument and performing. This means he is presently a stay-at-home-parent, and we are living off one income, and it is rather difficult. 

Ideally, I see us in a place where we can both work. A place that is safe. Multicultural. Big enough for there to be a clientele for his niche genre of music (I mean Ireland would be his best bet but we *attempted* to move there two years ago and failed). A place where people are friendly enough, where I can make decent money (at least comparable to my current 46K CAD), where language barriers won’t be too extreme, where there are nice parks and public spaces to be used. 

I’ve probably just listed my dream city, all in the hopes that someone can give me some specific suggestions that I can research more in depth. I’m in the process of getting my certification in other provinces in Canada, but we are open to other options as well. I’m currently looking into Singapore a bit. I’m open to the Middle East but a little apprehensive about human rights/treatment of women, and not to mention *war*.  Likewise with Asian countries that are close to NK. 

So, where have you gone? How was your experience? 

Thanks in advance!!

So, I'm fairly new to teaching (and quite late to the party - I'm 30 years old already). I gathered some experience teaching languages at a university and at a private language school in the course of the last year, and it was a great experience for me. I found out that I enjoy explaining, speaking about languages, helping people express themselves, and discuss cultures and traditions. I have had very positive feedback from my instructors, colleagues and students.

Now I took on a language assistant position at a regular school in a different country - and I'm facing problems. I'm not a natural with kids or teenagers, and I'm having a hard time connecting with them. I have about 20 different classes, ages between 12 and 18 - that has been pretty overwhelming for me. I'm not good with names or faces, and I'm still mixing them up all the time (although I'm getting better).

I normally take a few girls with me out of the normal classes and do some conversation practise with them. A few times I've been left alone with the whole class (spontaneously, so I didn't have anythig prepared for them to do), and that has been rather catastrophic. The 12-year-olds didn't show any respect for me, they don't recognise me as a teacher. Some of them make fun of me (""We love you..."", said in a very ironic way) or shout my name in the corridor. They don't say anything insulting, but you can feel that they try to have their way with me and maybe see how far they can go. I don't know how to react to that. I'm a quiet person and a bit insecure in my ways - I guess they feel that. I have started to warn them, tell them off, that I'd be giving them bad marks or not let them participate in certain things. But then, there's only so much I can do, since I'm not really giving them grades they can see in the end. I feel very insecure and am not really sure what would be the best way to behave. I'm generally not much of a group person or an entertainer, and my strengths lie in being supportive and helpful, and being good and patient at explaining.

I actually feel rather comfortable when I'm in the role of the ""proper"" teacher; having an agenda, a goal and lesson planned. When I'm in front of a class, I start acting; I know I'm the one in charge, so I speak loudly and take the initiative. Since I don't really get the chance of doing proper lessons here at the school, I can't really test how that would work with the difficult girls here in class, and if I would be able to maintain a good classroom discipline in such a context.

What I do know though is that I'm really not good with the girls in a ""private"" context, meeting them in the corridor or before the proper classes start. Speaking with them spontaneously is hard for me; I'm not sure what to say, which topics to speak about with them, where the boundaries lie and when I should tell them off. I feel they regard me as awkward, insecure and maybe even laughable (not all of them, for sure, but some of them). I know I do come off as awkward sometimes, and I have a humour and tastes that are not for everyone (especially not for kids). I'm fine with that, but I don't know how to make my personality work with the girls.

I'm not sure if teaching young people is for me in the long run - but I would like to take as much out of this year as possible (and overall, I'm enjoying my experience!). I would like to become more assertive and respected - and I have no idea how to do that. Any advice is warmly appreciated!

My mentor teacher and I will be meeting before the start of the new semester just so we can get to know each other a bit and likely lay out expectations. What are some questions I should ask her? I'm assuming I'll learn things like her behavioral management plan while in the classroom, so is it acceptable to ask about dress code for teachers, what time its expected I be there, etc? If anyone could give me some guidelines or a list of what are important things to cover in my questions, that would be great! Also, What do I wear to this meeting? It won't be around kids or during school hours since it will still be winter break, though we may still meet at school. Should I still wear a professional outfit like dress pants or would jeans be acceptable?

What do student teachers usually bring to school with them every morning? My mom just gifted me a large purse type bag that can easily fit computer, planner, file folder full if stuff, etc. I'm not sure if I really need that, or if I should bring myself and a planner. What's the norm here?


Also, does anyone here use an Apple Watch? I have one and I've heard it can be really useful in the classroom for setting quick timers, etc. What are your opinions on them? My concern is that it might look a bit unprofessional.


Final question: an old retired teacher suggested that I prepare a file folder/binder with all sorts of worksheets and lessons in case something comes up and I need to teach something quickly. She suggested I just buy some learning books for kids and go to the online resources to find print offs and ideas there. Does this seem like a good advice? I'm worried it might seem a bit pretentious walking inside a classroom with binders full of lessons on the first week.

I'm studying to become a teacher and am currently an ""intern"" at a school (don't know the proper English word for it, but we're a handful of students who are placed into a school for six weeks each year as part of our education). We're currently in a 2nd grade class.

Anyway, on our first day we are told by the teacher assigned to us that she has a student who must be handled... gently. He is completely uninterested in school, wanders around the classroom doing whatever he wants, including disturbing the other students, even having full conversations with them *while* we're trying to teach. He doesn't respond to requests, instructions or criticism, and if you try to stop him from being disruptive, he resists - often violently. And if you have the audacity to actually physically direct or restrain him - woooh, you're in for a treat.

When I ask what methods they've tried with him, ""our"" teacher makes it pretty obvious that their handling of this student was quickly boiled down to ""let's not piss him off, because he will cry for an hour if necessary"", and so they give us a standing ""order"" to simply leave him be and only intervene when he is actively disrupting others. Which is constantly. This ""soft"" approach is emulated by every teacher in the school, so he basically has free reign, and the other 2nd graders have made note of it, leading to other students acting similarly.

Anyways, this week I got to finally spend some proper time with him, after two weeks of only observing, and today he decided he wanted to go outside and play in the snow. During class. Something he announces to everyone around him. So off he goes, and I follow, after getting permission from my teacher to try to handle him. I've had my suspicions for a while about why he acts the way he does, so I'm happy to finally get the chance to test my theory.

I stop him as he's zipping up his jacket, telling him we need to finish class before we go outside. I've built up a really good rapport with him over the previous two days by incorporating the subject we're teaching (fairytales) into a simplified game of D&amp;D/Blades in the Dark, which he thought was awesome, while it also allowed me to ""sneak"" my teaching into the game so that he got most of what the rest of the class was getting in the other room (oh yeah, if you want to get ANYTHING done, he apparently has to have his own room to ""work"" in). This rapport meant nothing now, though, as I gently told him that no, he could not go outside because he ""was going to"".

This... annoyed him.

He started small by whining and moaning while pushing weakly at me to get away from the door leading outside. I told him we had to stay inside, but that if he just told me he was going to go back to class, I would even go in first, because I trusted him (this [the trust part] was a lie, I'll admit). He refuses to answer, instead ramping up his shitty behavior by now pushing me hard and trying to bend my fingers. I close my fist so that he lets go and tell him not to do that. He continues, so I firmly lift him three feet away from me, which pisses him off. He comes back swinging, and I meet his fist with a light open-hand slap (to his fist) that halts the punch, which makes him pause. I'm still completely calm, as this really is just an issue of correcting his behavior by calmly showing him the consequences of his actions, in my opinion, and I tell him that he is not allowed to do that, and if he does it, people will do the same to him, which I don't like or want to do, ""let's be friends again, please"".

He resumes pushing at me, but now also throws in a barrage of angry punches and begins pinching and scratching me, so I give him a light, but firm push away from me, so that he's at arm's length again. I give him what I hope is a sad, sympathetic smile and tell him I don't like what we're doing right now, and that no one should be pushing or pinching or punching, or shoving, for that matter, but that I am NOT going to let him just hurt me like that. All while concentrating on being completely calm, as I think aggression is what really harms a child the most, not necesarily the use of a certain amount of force. If you remain calm and don't allow yourself to get angry, or at least to *show it*, I think a child who doesn't ""get"" verbal instructions regarding their violent behavior, might understand the ""action--&gt;consequences"" part of it when you respond by, say, pushing them away if they try something violent. Not all kids, but some.

Anyway, at this point he takes a step closer and tells me he is going to bring a gun to school (""I have one at home"") that he will shoot me in the eye with, and that he'll stab me with a knife. I respond ""no"" and hold out my hand in a ""stop"" motion when he takes another step. He stops and regards me, unsure what to do. He's forgotten how angry he is, for the moment, but is quickly working that out in his head. I tell him I will move as soon as he confirms that he will return to class, because I trust him.

So he stabs me in the chest with a pencil.

It's a quick overhand stab that, thankfully, doesn't penetrate my skin, and I push him to the ground before he can get another one in, but I decided then that I was DONE with this shit. I tell him in my calmest furious tone that he will *not* do that again, and yank the pencil out of his hand and toss it in the trash before going down to one knee and grabbing him in what was basically a reverse bear hug. At this point he goes through an escalation of emotion similar to what I'd just seen over the past fifteen minutes, but within the span of seconds. He pushes, punches, pinches and scratches, before finally starting to howl, with tears and everything.

Thing is, *anyone* who has *ever* worked in a kindergarden knows this type of crying. It's the fakest, most forced howling I've ever heard. The only thing giving it such ""force"" is the intensity he puts into it. And it's at this point I realize that all of this shitty behavior of his is simply a tool he uses to get his way - confirming my suspicions. At least to the best of my limited knowledge, granted, but I'm confident of it. I've noticed him constantly monitoring us adults whenever he acts out, gauging for our reactions, and this is exactly the same, except it's his trump card. So, once I feel certain that I haven't actually hurt him (I was *really* careful - I believe in a limited, rare use of force in certin instances, never as punishment or something reactionary), I simply turn off my brain and ignore him, thinking of the D&amp;D campaign I'm planning nowadays, while telling him calmly that I will not let go until he tells me what we should do here. But he persists.

Then, suddenly, there's a hand on my shoulder, and another reaching for the boy. It's one of the assistants who often spends alone time with him. She smiles apologetically at me and mutters something about having to go, then grabs him and repeats herself, at which point I hear what she says, that she had offered to take him. Before I can object, she has already asked him if they should go to the play room, at which point he instantly calms down and comes with her without a fight. I was left dumbfounded and absolutely furious at myself for not speaking up and stopping her, but it was too late, and my whole effort was wasted. I was fucking *stabbed* for nothing.

At least I feel confident now as to what his problem is: adults. WE are the problem, not him. He's a pretty normal kid, and smart about the things that interest him. Our teacher has never seen him finish a full session of teaching (45 minutes), yet I kept him talking about fairytales (during D&amp;D), various ships (he LOVES ships, especially the *Titanic*, and wants to be a shipwright) and even god damn atoms and electrons for two whole hours without even moving from his seat. The kid *gets it*, but for now only when presented through a fun medium. So no, the problem is *us*, and what signals we're sending.

His problem is that no one sets any boundaries for him, or presents consequences to his shitty actions. I've asked our teacher about his parents, who claim that ""he's perfectly fine at home"", which indicates to me that he is allowed to do whatever he wants, despite his parents otherwise being good, seemingly responsible people. The way he talks himself also indicates this. This, of course, makes our job as teachers much harder (if true). But even if parents fail at boundaries, we must be consistent in enforcing them, so as to give the kids a predictable everyday life.

This is not what our school does, and I'm unsure how to handle it - to the degree that I should get further involved at all. Instead of uniting in correcting his behavior and sending him a clear message, the agreed upon strategy between ALL the 2nd grade teachers is to allow him to roam freely and do his own thing (not learning shit), even walk into *other* classrooms and wander around there as well. It's absolute mayhem, and even though they admit that he is WAY behind everyone else on the curriculum(?) and simply cannot be evaluated in several subjects due to his load of incomplete work/attendance, they still aren't changing *their own* behavior.

I've seen how smart he is, and how he *is* able to sit still for extended periods, but his wiring is such now that he's ""allergic"" to doing what he's supposed to do, and I think he's simply rejected school in general as something he just doesn't ""get"" or needs to participate in. I firmly believe that it's *our* fault, but I don't know how to broach this or how to propose a plan to change our strategy. Me and my group of fellow students are only here for three more weeks, so our influence is limited, but I *really* want there to be a change in how they deal with this kid. He deserves better.

I've taught third grade for the past couple of years. Last year I was at a rougher school in my hometown (that I still enjoyed), this year I thought I'd try something different and moved to a new town and better school. Yet I found my enthusiasm for teaching just plummeted. With each passing week I've bought less and less into the system, found myself unmotivated, gotten fed up with the bureaucracy of the job, and, frankly, looked at my paychecks and bills and felt like I could be doing better

A lot of other teachers can grind through all these things because teaching and working with students is their passion. I enjoy teaching kids, but it's not something I'm passionate about; I derive my passion from things completely independent of teaching (writing fiction, reading, running, music)

So I've decided I'm going to ride out the year and look for new work. I hold a degree in communication in addition to my teaching degree, and have some skills outside of teaching. But I'm very nervous that I won't find anything and will be faced with (potential) unemployment 

My parents think I should stay in teaching until I find something else. I told them that's too risky, I don't wanna start a new school year and then potentially bail on them. Not only that, but I feel employers will be hesitant cause they'll see a guy trying to bail during a school year

I'm going to start poking around for jobs this evening, just to see what's out there. To be frank, I feel like I'd be ok with some mundane 9-5 office job if it paid decently, because again, my passions are independent of my work, and as long as I have the time for those (which I don't as much with teaching), I'll be alright

Advice needed.,"So, long story short, I am a 22-year-old new teacher that graduated from a College of Ed last May, and am now teaching High School TV Productions. I was supposed to be teaching English, as this is what I am certified in, but they gave me TV productions because I took that very same class all four years of high school, and taught the previous teacher how to use all the equipment when he came in to teach the class during my senior year of high school. 

I am teaching at my old high school, everyone says I am doing a better job than the previous teacher, but I still have to pass a certification test per my agreement-to-earn. 

The problem is, the exam is ""Engineering and Technology Education 6-12."" Not just simply TV Productions. On the exam, the topics range from: agriscience, biomedicine, electric, engineering, manufacturing, woodworking, automotive mechanics, physics, and a little bit of math.

I took the test one time. not a SINGLE TV production question on there, because the exam encompasses all of the Career and Technical Education classes (CTE). 

In short, what the hell am I supposed to do? My mentor and my admins all say that it's bullshit that I have to do this. I've heard ""Oh, principals can work a lot of magic if they really want someone in a position."" Even my own administrators have told me, ""You're not going anywhere."" But this still doesn't reassure me. I am still freaking out.

I guess I'm just looking for support from teachers who have been in the game. I'm teaching in Florida, if that puts anything into perspective.

I just think it's important to share with those who are considering going into teaching, and I'm also interested to hear teachers' opinions on what happened. I have been working as a paraeducator since then, and that unfortunately hasn't worked out, either. I care deeply about education, so it hurts to realize that it just may not be the career for me. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and a Masters degree in Education (the degree I got after choosing not to get a teaching credential). 

Here's my story:

I saw getting into the Masters in Teaching program as a way to find purpose again after having a difficult college experience. Teaching was more real-world than anything I had done in four years, so I was excited and passionate to start. 

I did well academically for 6 months until I had to write a unit plan. I failed it miserably, and was told to re-do it over winter break. I felt terrible, because I knew I hadn’t asked for enough help on it, but I had felt relatively confident that I had understood it as I wrote it. I re-did it, and I improved it. Then, student teaching started. It was with a classroom of kids that I already knew from the previous fall, and I was excited to work with them again. 

I liked learning from my mentor, and I liked working with the kids, but being up in front of the room and managing the behaviors of all of those kids felt terrifying, no matter how calm I stayed through it and no matter how firm I made my voice. The kids didn’t really listen to anything I was saying, and there was a noticeable difference in how they behaved when their ‘regular teacher’ was in the room and how they behaved when he wasn’t in the room.

I found it exhausting and overwhelming to have to stop the lesson several times just to re-direct them and try to assert authority and purpose in the room. I felt there was no way for me to get better at teaching a lesson when this just kept happening. I secretly felt like kind of a victim, but I rationally knew that this is what kids will do: they test authority. But, even though I had no actual resentment for the kids at all, and I actually enjoyed working with every single one of them on all of their subjects, I just didn’t see myself in a place where I could get better at it. I felt like the mentor and my advisors were doing everything they could to help me, but I increasingly saw that I was lacking in knowledge on things that they couldn’t provide me with.

The Common Core lessons asked me to teach things that I don’t think I ever really learned to do. It was totally different from my own school experience, even though I was only 22 years old at the time. It’s not like it’s been 30 years since I was in elementary school. It’s only been fourteen years since I ‘graduated’ 5th grade. I was in 1st grade in 2000. Yet, it’s already a totally different world.

Picking out character traits from a character in a story was something I don’t think I was asked to do until I was maybe 15-17 years old and in high school English classes. In 1st grade, our teacher read us stories and we got phonics worksheets. Read-alouds done by our teacher were for fun more than anything else, and it got us to enjoy the book. Now, they are asking us to have kids pull out character traits, when back then, it was just story time, or getting the kids to like the story. That doesn’t really seem to matter anymore. I found the atmosphere stifling, rigid, and I was totally unprepared both for the management part of it and what I was being asked to teach. You can’t teach something if you know nothing about it. It was a sad realization, but I knew that because of it, I had to stop before I kept failing. The last thing I wanted to do was to work hard on the EdTPa certification test thing, and fail because I never even learned what I was supposed to be teaching, at least not in a 1st grade context.

I didn’t really know how to explain that I didn’t really understand what the standards were asking kids to do. They were, oddly enough, questions that I had never really considered. It was my sense of social justice and wanting to work with kids that pushed me to become a teacher. Plus, since I had gotten straight As throughout my K-12 years, I started thinking that because I had figured out how to do well, at least regarding grades, that I could help others also do well in that regard. I didn’t think I was better than anyone. It was just a desire to help people. I’ve always known that while grades truly don’t measure everything, it was what colleges and future employers would be looking at. I thought I could help kids get the best grades that they could, and hopefully learn some meaningful things in the process.

But, back to why I dropped out of student teaching. Classroom management was exhausting. I soon needed to film some of my lessons for my EdTPa segment, and I couldn’t even keep the class under control. I felt like there were 80 different things that needed my attention when I was at the front of the room, and it was basically sensory overload. I had to attend to my own feelings, which were pretty much just telling me to run and get the hell out of there, and I had be aware of what all of the kids were doing, and I had to actually be teaching somewhere in there. I had never experienced anything like it. I of course believed that I could get better, but probably not in time for this test that I was supposed to take to get certified. I just wasn’t progressing fast enough. There didn’t seem to be much natural ability there to help me through.
Despite all that, the passion for wanting to help the kids never went away, and I loved getting to know and work with each and every one of the kids in the classroom. I still miss them. 

I think part of it is that I’ve tended to function better in small groups for my entire life. I’m also an only child, and I’ve always had at least 1 or 2 close friends to confide in, but in giant groups of people, I would just leave the room unless I was immersed in some small-group activity. I wish that had occurred to me before I went into student teaching, but I guess you never know what you’ll be in any context until you try it.

Both programs look great to me and I would be happy to go to both. What I'm wondering is, does it matter for future job prospects that I have Harvard on my resume? I know its just for a masters program, not undergrad. Has anyone gone to either school and have some additional insight?

Just looking for advice overall on what is important in getting a teaching job, if programs matter to future employers, and if the cost is worth it for Harvard (I have savings and would not need to take a load out, but it is still significant to me).

Then there are ""field experience required"" courses. So that means you have to start right away in getting experience at a school I guess..

Need serious advice. Substitute Teacher,"I am my building's substitute teacher.  I get to know the students fairly well but do not see all of them on a regular basis.  The majority of the kids like and enjoy me and the teachers trust me to follow their plans.  The administration enjoys me as well, well enough to rush me into my position at the beginning of this year from a floater.  Ninety percent of the kids are fine and if they aren't, they are normal middle school annoying.  You know... chatty, distracted, trying too hard to be funny, etc.

And then there are our eighth graders.  Never before have a met a group of students so downright disrespectful and rude.  Its to the point where most of the 8th grade teachers have just given up (considering the administration will let them graduate anyway regardless of grades or behavior).  I've asked for advice and was told to pick my battles wisely. Here are some of the highlights (and there is way way way more than this).


""I'm not listening to you.  If I don't do what you say then you'll get in trouble because you suck at your job.""


""I'm having an allergic reactions to cats, I need to leave."" This said while another student asked if I was going to punish them for breathing and another was throwing stuff.  The student in question, no allergies.


""What are you going to do about it?  Call my parents, they'll have you fired.""


""You don't know anything, if you did you would be a REAL teacher""


""Maybe if you didn't talk back to me then I wouldn't be so rude.  After all, you deserve it."" I asked him to stop talking during directions.


""We already got one sub fired, maybe we can get you fired too. We just have to tell the principal a couple things.""

I have one male student that always seems to find me alone.  I move to the hallway were there are others.  I've reported this.

""What gives you the right to tell us what to do.""

""This isn't your classroom and we don't have to listen.  If you try to make us, we'll just tell Ms. so and so it was you that broke stuff.""

Two students got into a fist fight last week so they could leave the room and not do work.

The teachers have given detentions.  They have called home.  They been given in school suspensions.  I've sent kids to the office, had the principal call home (he offered) and I legit but need some advice/coping mechanisms.   Because I think that I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  I've had it with them.  I love my job and I would never want to leave but I need some advice.  Note that I'm 25, I've never tried to be friends with them, I follow a strict set of rules for myself ( I never touch my phone, I dress professionally, I'm involved), I have a good relationship with the teachers (I'm an alumni of the school) and I'm certified to teach in two states K-12.",,83k7vs,,0,,false,1522286609,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,"",false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/83k7vs/at_my_wits_end_with_our_8th_graders_need_serious/,,"",,,

Right now I’m feeling pretty lost on my career and finding a direction to go in the future. I’m currently a site coordinator for a federal grant funded after school program at a middle school and I having my teaching certification in History and Geography in Michigan.  Through my job now I also hold a childcare license in my name for the program and have been receiving continuous training in this area. I graduated from college in 2015 and I found my current job in the fall of 2016, so this is my first actual job that is in my field. 

My job is dependent on whether or not funding will be continued the next year and we are about to rewrite our grant in hopes of continuing it for the next 5 year. There also isn’t any room to grow in the position I am in currently. From working in this position I’ve come to realize that I don’t really have a passion for teaching in a normal classroom and I prefer working with youth in the ways I get to in the after school program.

My question really is, what else could I do that is still related to the field with the education and experience that I already have now, if I do not want to seek out a teaching position?

Currently I am in touch with the principal and another 4th grade teacher. I am looking for any advice, tips, and tricks! 

What I am thinking of doing: 

1. Sending letters home to the parents about what they can expect and what their child needs to bring. 

2. Sending a brief postcard to the students welcoming them and saying something along the lines of, ""once you have found your seat with your nametag, your first assignment will be filling out a questionnaire in order for me to get to know you better"" 

3. Creating a syllabus 

4. Setting up routines 

5. Creating a student contract 

6. Creating lesson plans a few weeks out

But nonetheless, lately I’ve had feelings of complete powerlessness. You know, when you’re met with defiance. Or even incessant whining. The stuff that makes your blood boil. And you act tough and stern but still... nada. No results. You may as well be addressing a wall. You may even tell a kid to go to the office and they will outright refuse. (And besides, some of them *want* to go to the office!) What now? Ignoring the disobedient child and continuing on with the rest of the kids sends the message that you accept the behaviour. But it’s not okay! And letting them get away with stuff like this is the CAUSE of all these issues. Lazy or lackadaisical parents. Not stern enough. Not insistent enough on general respect. 

I’m a parent myself and I love the gentle parenting style, but if it doesn’t work I have to be more stern and be hands on. I follow through with my “threats”.  If me or my husband say that my toddler must stop fooling around during story time so that *others* can enjoy the story, and he doesn’t, then we leave! It seems simple, yet I see other parents intentionally turn a blind eye to things like this. I feel this is very problematic. 

There is little fear in kids these days of authority figures. That makes me sound like an old fart but I’m not. I started off my teaching career a few short years ago lauding respect and relationships and community in the classroom (I also started my practicum in an incredible independent school), but sometimes I feel this just isn’t *enough*. There’s something missing. 

Maybe I want to be liked, but I wouldn’t mind being feared a little more. I’ve adopted more “feeling” in my approach (guilt tactics?) I tell kids how I am a person too with feelings, and how their behaviour is unacceptable at times, and I do get the silence I’m looking for when I scold, only to have the ruckus continue when I’ve turned my back. 

What are your thoughts on this?

What are the ingredients to success here?

Behaviour management, I realize, comes up daily on this sub. I read lots of stuff and understand the basics but still have trouble coming to terms with it all. It’s all the more frustrating when it seems the parenting component is perhaps lacking; can we make enough of an impact? Can we change some bad habits? Can we just make them *see*? 

I’m starting fresh next year and I want to get it right. 

Looking as much for discussion here as I am for tips. 

And as for tips, what are your own tried and true consequences? How much patience do you have for milder offences? When do you let things go?

In two years I'm going to be graduating from a school in Florida with a degree in English Language Arts Education, but I likely won't be pursuing any work opportunities in Florida. When my fiancée graduates (same time as me), she will be pursuing her PHD, looking primarily at a few specific schools in CO, MT, and CA. I'd really like to follow her wherever she goes, but I'm worried that my lack of connections in these places will make it very difficult to find work, especially since I won't have any real secondary teaching experience. By the time I graduate, I'll have completed two secondary-level internships in English classrooms, as well as quite a bit of tutoring at the college level, a semester of TA work from my university, and some summer advising positions.

At this point, I don't think I have enough space in my academic schedule to become certified in any other subjects, so 6-12 English will likely be the only core subject that I'll be certified to teach coming out of college. I will have an ESOL endorsement though, and I'll graduate with university honors and I'm on track to graduate summa cum laude, if that's worth anything.

So, do you think anyone will be willing to hire me? Ideally, my partner and I are aiming for the Boulder-Denver area, which would have the most potential job openings of anywhere she wants to go to school. If I can't get a job teaching that first year, what would be the next best thing that could help make me more competitive? I imagine that I might be able to apply for some university staff positions, specifically in advising and student affairs since I will have had experience in those areas from various positions I've worked at my school. I'm not sure what else I could really do though, outside of tutoring and subbing.

Do you have any suggestions for what color palette should I use? [Repost from /r/edtech],"**I want to use a white background for now**. We usually write on white papers. Our book pages are usually white. So I thought the video backgrounds should be white too. But I can change that later.

I watched some videos of [KhanAcademy](https://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy). **KhanAcademy uses black backgrounds in each of their videos**. And the results are astonishing. They use so many foreground colors to write letters or fonts in their videos. **Black background gives them the advantage to use varieties of colors -- white, red, blue, yellow even pink. And each letter stands out.** I think this has direct effects on drawing and keeping student's concentration and focus throughout the video.

But as I want to white background, the range of colors for foreground (words and stuffs) are surprisingly small. **You can use black, red and blue. Even black and blue sometimes can't make enough distinction and can't be told apart separately. The other colors don't really stand out.** Like among blue, red and black fonts, you won't be able to find the green colored fonts easily.

Do you have any advice about a particular choice of colors that will help in keeping student's focus throughout an entire 15 minute video with a white background? Any suggestion would be appreciated.

I decided I'd just get the degree and then try to find a job with my degree that wasn't teaching. 

What I don't like about the job is just about everything. Everything I did was just enough to get by. I tried my best to have a good mindset going in that the day would be different but deep down I just didn't feel that way. I have no passion or desire for it. Classroom management is stressful. While parents aren't bad, I have found that one rotten apple in the bunch can really wear you down. Anytime I teach, even after deliver a hundred lessons, I am full of anxiety. I went home everyday crying and dreading going in the next day. If I can't stand being here, then that's going to show eventually and the kids deserve a teacher who cares.

 My family was extremely happy when I graduated and they're asking what school I want to work for and how the job search is going. I don't know how to tell them I am not looking for a job in school. I have told my mom but she keeps urging me to teach. I can tell without a shadow of doubt this job is not something I should do. 

I guess what I am really wondering is if there are other careers I can do that I qualify for even with a teaching degree. I am sorry if this is the wrong place for this.

1. Pro- They will assume I am just another teacher. And how I do things are what's expected by other teachers. (I'm hoping to lay some good project management ground work... ideally lol)

So about a year and a half ago now I graduated with my Masters in teaching, but I've had 0 luck finding a full time job teaching grades 8-12 English in my state (MA). In that time I've applied for over 200 jobs, and gotten 3 interviews. The only jobs I've been able to land are subbing jobs at a few local high schools, and one 6 week long job teaching MCAS prep for the English test (10th grade). 

There's a lot of things happening in my life that really need me to land a job, the main one being health insurance. I have medical bills that would total almost $5,000 a month without insurance, and even with insurance it's expensive. My converage with my parents' insurance expires in November. With what I make now subbing, I'd have to forgo treatment and be basically worthless.

So, I'm wondering if any of you out there could offer me some sound advice. Should I look to another state (I've looked in RI and NH with no success), another country? I don't want to give up on what I'm so passionate about, but by the time November rolls around if I don't have coverage I'll have to go on state health insurance with premiums I'm not sure I can afford, among other things. Perhaps I am just not experienced enough to get a job? I'd like to think with my time subbing and working in schools that I know how to at least begin to teach students, and everyone has to start somewhere. I honestly love, LOVE teaching and being a part of the education system in any way I can. 

I think my resume and cover letter are decent enough. I even made a video cover letter of me just talking into my webcam for a more personalized approach to things, perhaps to stand out. But I'm not sure. I must be making some mistakes somewhere.

1.  Assessment: What sort of assessment do you assign to hold students accountable?  How do you avoid an enormous pile of essays on day one of the school year?  In addition, what is it you assess with summer reading? 

2.  Accountability: What happens if a student has not completed the summer reading?  (Especially if your first unit is based upon the summer reading.)

3.  Access: Do you provide copies of the text to all students, or are they responsible for getting their own?

I've posted here before and got some great advice, and I'd like to do it again.
I'm currently planning a lesson with the goal that students will understand the kind of jobs they can get by studying physics, and more broadly what it is that physicists do. I think I came up with a good idea, but it feels very non-traditional and I want to get your feedback. 

Here's the idea:
I'm thinking of having students set up their own LinkedIn profile (just the bare bones to save time), add their classmates as connections, and have them use the website's search tool to look for local science and engineering jobs. I want them to identify local jobs related to physics, and identify the job's description, requirements, and salary. 

Pros:
-This activity gives some ""authenticity"" to the class and subject. 
-This activity could help students start thinking of their resume and eventually apply for jobs/colleges.

Cons:
-Is this legal? Can I make students sign up for a service online? Do I need to get a permission slip for this?
-May take waaaay longer than I think it might.
-May backfire, i.e. scare the kids away from the field once they see confusing job requirements.

I was wondering if you could give me some advice. Since June, I've been trying to get my student loans forgiven using the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program.

My experience has been really dreadful, but the most frustrating part is Fedloan is denying me for reasons that are obviously false.
My first denial (7/03/17) said I didn't have basic information like dates and name and title of the chief officer, but I did have all of that so I called them and they said they couldn't see anything wrong and they would resubmit.

I wait 3 weeks and get denied again for almost the exact same reasons. I'm looking at my application and everything's there, so I'm just baffled.

Call them up again and they say I need to check that I've previously applied for forgiveness. They were very explicit about this. They also said to have my end date changed from 08/12/2017 to when my contract actually ended in June (My district prorates my pay so I actually get paid through the summer).

So I change everything and resubmit and they deny me on 8/10 saying that I haven't completed my 5th year which ends on 8/12. I'm assuming they did not use my updated application. Here's the actual denial reason:

(NOT ELIGIBLE: Your Chief Administrative Officer certified an academic year end date that is in the future. You are not eligible for forgiveness until you have completed your five years of qualifying teaching service. At that point, you will need to reapply for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program.)

I call and try to get things figured out, even get bumped up to a superior. I'm told that I should not have checked that I had applied or received loan forgiveness and they apologized for giving me wrong information.

So I fix everything per their directions, submit again, wait almost three weeks, and I just received another denial (8/31/2017) for the exact same reason as the previous denial:

(NOT ELIGIBLE: Your Chief Administrative Officer certified an academic year end date that is in the future. You are not eligible for forgiveness until you have completed your five years of qualifying teaching service. At that point, you will need to reapply for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program.)

This is not possible, as I reapplied on 8/14/2017 which is past 8/12/2017.

So, I'm really upset and frustrated. I'm tired of getting the runaround and I'm wondering if they're even looking at my application before denying it. It takes them almost 3 weeks to get back to me and they always send it late Friday night, so I have to wait through the weekend to call them.

Anyways, aside from calling again on Tuesday and resubmitting which I plan to do, what are my options? Also, has anyone else experienced this? If so, were you able to get it resolved? What did you have to do?

I just don't feel like this is fair.",,6xnx43,,0,,false,1507292603,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/6xnx43/fedloan_keeps_denying_my_teacher_loan_forgiveness/,,,,,

The nature of music class is very different from their homeroom in that it is mostly whole group instruction where everyone is participating at one time on one thing. For example, it's rare that there is an activity where they're working totally independently or in small groups where they can talk quietly with another. we do a lot of singing and games and movement things where I need their full attention on me or on the whole group activity. 
Right now, the consequences I have set up are:
-verbal warning
-""safe seat"" which is basically time out (part of our school's disciple system)
-buddy room (they go to a different classroom to remove themselves)
-office 

I don't know when to actually start giving out verbal warnings tho. I don't want to give one out the very first time they speak out of turn because then everyone would have a verbal warning. And I think that's a bit too harsh? The art teacher does 3 verbal warning where she puts a little flag on their desk that's says 1, 2, or 3 that symbolizes which warning they're on. I can't do that in music class. We are constantly moving and it would be too much work to run over to a notepad or on the board and write ""Allison - 1"" or whatever to show the verbal warnings.

- Horseplay
- Throwing objects
- Throwing objects and accidentally hitting me
- Swearing
- Inappropriate jokes
- Running around the room after being repeatedly asked to sit down
- Inappropriate comments about me (So-and-so thinks you are hot, etc)
- Screaming
- Attempting to leave the room without permission. I had to round them back up.
- Using cellphones/laptops (which they are allowed to have in school for academic use only, but making sure 30 kids aren't playing games is ridiculously hard)
- listening to music out loud on portable speakers
- spilling food/drink everywhere (which they are allowed to have)
- I asked one student if he was watching videos on biology and he flat out admitted he was watching videos on ""reproduction""
- Only 50% of the class does any work at all
- No one listens to me, other students have to yell at each other to try and maintain order.
- A small altercation that I'm glad didn't get more out of hand.

I don't remember my freshman year of high school being like this AT ALL. I'm sure we weren't angels but I don't remember disrespecting authority so badly. I didn't expect this at the high school level. All of this happened in just 2 days, and one of those days was a half day! I try to maintain some sort of order but I lack the authoritative voice I guess. It doesn't help that I'm extremely short and young looking for my age, so I don't have any natural authority in the way I look. The biggest issue of it all, is that I actually find myself entertained by their antics. I try to suppress the smile on my face when they do something ""bad"" but they still notice. They even said ""Look she just laughs!"". I was told by a student that I was the coolest sub ever and that I should be a teacher, but I'm pretty sure it's only because I didn't flip out when he spilled his pepsi all over the floor. 

I'm hesitating taking my next job on Monday. Being in a classroom was a constant state of anxiety, like I never know who is going to figuratively light themselves on fire next. Because of my luck with 9th graders, I'm scared of working in a middle school. I've considered elementary school, but I was wanting to avoid it because I have the least amount of experience with that age group. I feel like 4th and 5th grade might be doable, but the school doesn't tell me what age group until I get there. I don't know if I would like the first grade, for example.

HELP. Do I give up and find new employment or am I just inexperience and will things get better?

**EDIT:** *Just wanted to say I appreciate and have read everyone's comments! I just took a substitute job for a teaching assistant at an elementary school, so not only will I get a feel for a new grade level, but I also won't be directly in charge of the classroom and I'll be able to watch and learn from a full time teacher.

Any Advice, ideas, or general knowledge from established teachers is what I'm after today. Thanks!","When I started college at the age of 27 I originally wanted to be a teacher but I didn't know what I wanted to teach. As I progressed in school I realized that not only was I good at Math and Physics but that I really enjoyed it. I started making A's and tutoring math and I think I got cocky and decided that I wanted to do the hardest thing I could think of, so I went into engineering. I am currently a 29yo Engineering student at NC State and I absolutly hate it. My grades are still good but I hate the subject. I find no joy at all in the classes and after talking to and meeting engineers I can find no joy in the thought of a future job in engineering. I was so caught up in the competitiveness of college and in trying to prove to myself that I was capable of engineering that I lost sight of whether or not I actually WANTED to be an engineer.

This led me to a bit of a crisis that made me remember why I was doing all of this, I wanted to be a teacher!

NCSU offers a B.S. in Science Education: Physics and I have decided that I'm going to leave engineering for STEM education. There are a lot of teachers in my family both STEM and nonSTEM. My mother teaches EC, my Aunt and Uncle teach Biology in Washington State, Another Uncle and Aunt teach shop and English respectively and my grandfather was a Physics Professor. My family has been extremely supportive of this decision including my wife who is a Biologist. My friends...less so.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me. Pros and cons of teaching? If you think this plan is a bad one, I'd like to know why. If you think it's a good one, please explain. Also if anyone has any tips or just general advice on what i'm getting myself into or on teaching STEM or teaching anything at all I would really appreciate it.

Thank you in advance! And I apologize to all the English teachers who are reading this and rolling their eyes at my terrible spelling and grammar skills.

Thanks for coming to help me :)

I’m a first year teacher and my fourth graders bombed a test so I’m going to reteach the content. For them, problems like “Jim has 5 boxes, Dan has 4 times as many, how many does Dan have? (4x5=20)” are very simple. 


But there’s a word problem that I am having trouble explaining. I am going to make sure to

    * teach the language of “as much as” means “equal”

    * teach “4 times as many” means “4 groups of ___”

    * insert people’s names for the unknowns in the problem

    * Rearrange it: 20=4x5, so we can translate it as a word sentence to say “20 is as much as 4 groups of 5”


Okay, here’s the word problem they bombed on the test: “Michael had 12 marbles. He had 2 times as many as Jose. How many marbles did Jose have?”

Everyone did 12x2=24. They needed to choose 12/2=6. 

I am having a lot of trouble thinking about how to explain why it is division. What words lead us to there, or how can we visualize why we divide? The reason I’m posting here is that a lot of the pedagogical videos online don’t deal with this specific situation!

To be clear, I absolutely love working with the kids and helping them discover and learn new things. I hate absolutely everything else about the job. 

No, I don't want to worry about gathering all this ""data"" from and for standardized testing, I don't want to join any committees that meet for the sake of meeting (in addition to all the other meetings I have to go to). I don't like how I've got/had students who have clearly been passed on because it would otherwise make numbers look bad and are now my issue, who will most likely continue to be low the following year because they can't get the help they really need. I don't like how my kids are being beat over the head about their ""data"" (my students are 8 and 9, they don't care). And I really don't like how, despite all the extra nonsense, a lot of kids still seem to be struggling. To boot, some of the people who work in education are, for lack of a better term, petty (and shallow as shit) 

My kids and I have an absolute blast together in class. It's not always perfect (I've got a few who don't care to be there, even in third grade), but we've had a lot of good learning experiences together, whether it's simple math concepts or learning about current affairs in social studies (or even just shooting the shit and discussing movies and video games and sharing silly memes). They really are the only good part of teaching 

Unfortunately,  this isn't enough for me to want to stay in the job. My friends and family all think I have more to offer than simply being a school teacher, and I'm starting to think the same. Plus,  the pay just doesn't justify the expectations.

I'm in the process of updating my resume and would like to find a new line of work. I hold two degrees (one in education, one in communication with a focus in journalism). In addition to my teaching experience (domestic and international), I've had a few experiences in journalism (just an internship at a local NPR station, working at the local PBS affiliate, etc) and have also participated in the local writing scene (I've written and published my own books, and have helped edit and publish local projects). I've also  got several years of retail experience, including having worked as a manager at Gamestop.

What kind of jobs should I be looking for with my experience? I live about an hour away from Chicago (with some of the suburbs closer), so there's plenty of options. Just not sure which way to go.

Make the assignment ""Improve a Wikipedia article""

If the student documents their attempts to improve a wikipedia article, it will always be a unique experience no matter what they do.  Secondly, the student is immediately peer reviewed... if a student make false changes, you'll know, their changes will be reverted and that will stand as a blemish on their grades.  Third, if a student is actually able to improve an article - they've contributed to the human knowledge base!  Good job!  And finally, if a student is unable to improve an article because it was well written or otherwise comprehensive, they've documented their process and how they came to the conclusion that they can't improve the article, they've also learned to copywrite, proof read, and fact check.

If you put a group students on the task of improving a Wikipedia article some of them may succeed, some may merely change a few typos, some may end up not being able to add anything - but their documentations of their attempts will all be very unique, the research requires significant due process, and it requires learning about the subject.",,7fr9bu,,0,,false,1512311059,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/7fr9bu/im_not_a_teacher_i_just_had_a_teaching_idea_about/,,,,,

Let me start from the beginning. When I was getting ready to go to college back in 2013, I had my heart set on being a history teacher in high school. I had my major as history, and I planned to pick up secondary education as another major once I actually started college. Long story short, people managed to convince me that teaching wasn't good, due to the pay, so I changed my major to criminal justice. About a year into college, I changed my major yet again to marketing and advertising, because I didn't think being a cop was for me.

Fast forward 4 years and I graduated, got a job in marketing, and well...I hated it. My boss wasn't the best, and I wasn't in a position I actually enjoyed, and I didn't feel fulfilled in the field. I got another job, again in marketing, which I start tomorrow.

However, I don't really feel like I will ever *love* what I'm doing in marketing, and will always think of it as just a job. Yeah, I know I only had one job and one experience, and I didn't even start my new job yet, but I don't feel accomplished.

I came to the conclusion that it's not all about money, like I thought in college, and I'd rather be doing something I actually enjoy then something I dislike everyday, even if it's at a lower pay (I don't actually *know* if teaching is a lower pay, but you get the idea).

I want to be doing something that makes me feel great, something that I actually have the power to make a difference in someone else's life, and that is why I wanted to be a teacher from the start (and, well, I love history). However, I still feel uneasy to make such a switch, and am scared I'll hate that too.

Any advice? My parents and friends say to give the new job a chance and I might actually like it, but, I don't know. Am I being too pessimistic?

I am working in China, Mostly I teach Public speaking and Debate, and on occasion I also assist with GCSE English and run supplementary reading and writing lessons for students at one of our International schools here in Beijing.

I ended up examining the things that were really triggering outbursts from the student and doing what I’d been taught to do in all my five years in university: adapt a system for a child when the system isn’t working.

I noticed that one of the big things that upset the student was my treasure box system. I give out tickets for good behavior and at the end of the week, I draw 3 tickets and those students get to pick something out of my treasure box. This works for pretty much all of my students. But for this student, getting treasure box = being good and not getting treasure box = being bad. If their name was not called, they would have a meltdown because they thought they were bad and *that’s* why they didn’t get treasure box. So clearly this wasn’t working for this student. I decided to male this student a sticker chart, and instead of earning tickets for good behavior, they earn stickers. If they earn 10 stickers, they get treasure box, and day of the week, doesn’t matter. As soon as they hit 10 stickers, the treasure box comes out. And the change in behavior has been *incredible*. Before, we were averaging about 3 full blown, on the floor crying and screaming, telling me and their parent that they hated us and how we were mad at them and how they were bad, meltdowns. Since the sticker system was implemented? Zero. In almost a month. They still have smaller meltdowns, but they are much more mild and easier to manage and much easier to pull them out of. And we have maybe one or two of those a week. And because of the success in my classroom, their school teacher and parent have also created positive reinforcement behavior systems at school and home.

Yesterday, the student’s parent gave me a hug when they came to pick up and thanked me for my role in helping. I told them that I was there for them in whatever way they needed. This just really reinforces my confidence in my ability to be a great teacher one day. I’ve been second guessing my decision to take a gap year at a daycare between college and getting a “real” teaching job, worried that it will not look good when I go to apply later and people will think I was just too weak to go straight into it or if I was wasting my time because I wouldn’t be getting any real applicable experience in a daycare, but I’m making a real, *tangible* difference in a child’s life. I’m using what I learned to help a child in need. I got into teaching out of a desire to advocate for students in need and I’m getting to do that even in a daycare setting.

My idea is to teach them how to create a line chart, then find the average of that and draw the line. From there they can find the increments and all of that. 

Then compare two graphs of averages. That should lead into comparing proportionals because they can see we only need 1 increment in an average to compare the two charts.

Now I start my Masters in Secondary Education in January am excited but scared. I didn't have a calling, me and many of my smart, hardworking friends have struggled in shit jobs in retail. I work outside at a hardware store in the freezing winter and scorching summer. Teaching seems stable. I like stability. The pay starts at 45k for a masters graduate in my local school system, in the poor South where that's not bad money. My friends seem to doubt my decision, saying I'll regret not taking risks and exploring in my 20s. This is a path to a middle class, not terrified of starving, stable life. One day I can have a family and spend time with my kids. I also perceive a good work/life balance (maybe wrongfully so) with the spring/summer/fall/winter breaks and MLK day and every other day off. 

Much of what led me to this decision had nothing to do with the nobility of it or saving the kids, but it seemed like a public administration I could live in and do well. Benefits, cash, off days. That being said, the more I think about it, the more I kind of like it. I believe in government and civics and think that it's a place where you really can make a difference. I would like to teach high school kids to think for themselves, to really actively think and show them the truth, as I see it. To pass down a worldview and morality that was given to me by a teacher I love dearly. This was one of the greatest gifts given to me in my life. I would like to be able to give it back to students who are perhaps on a similar path as I was.

I really, really like working with young adults and when I return to the States, I'd like to become a humanities/liberal arts teacher at either a high school or, ideally, at a college. 

Right now, I am trying to figure out how to best spend my free time here in Japan so I have something to show for all the time I spent out in the wilderness, so to speak, and what to do when I inevitably return to the States.

The biggest questions I have:

* I'm having trouble convincing myself how understanding Japanese culture and being bilingual will make me a more competitive candidate for grad schools. What are your thoughts on people who spent time living/working abroad before applying to grad school?

* What Masters degree should I be looking at? A Masters in Education? A Masters in Fine Arts? Secondary Education? It's a little overhwhelming how many options there are. 

* The biggest thing I worry about is my 2.5 GPA. If you were to just look at classes I took during the last two years, my GPA was 3.2. Again, I'm having trouble convincing myself that makes any real difference as far as admissions is concerned. After all, isn't a big reason why GPA is so important for graduate programs is to see a students history in whether or not they are capable of handling the work load that accompanies the pursuit of a graduate degree?

This is my first semester teaching ESL online after many years of face to face instruction. I now use Moodle as my main way of sending out instructor information and sending out assignments and homework.

The mandate by the government who funds the program requires students to have a portfolio. In face to face instruction, this was easily done by giving students a binder.

Do any teachers have any ideas on how to store portfolios online? I am wondering if something exists where I can post work for students to complete, and then at the end have an option to download the students work into a zip file or PDF. Is this wishful thinking?!

So we set the meeting for yesterday (so last Friday) and it was basically the principal that showed up from that school and the secretary. There was also one of the school board human resources worker that I've been working with for several years. 

Basically we went through what they had written about my day(s) and about what I had written. It was as if they had written a completely different day than I did. I know you guys don't know me and that is no way to trust me but they basically wrote down that I had asked the gym to switch gym days and to take my class a Thursday afternoon so that I could have the afternoon off. It's completely false. What I did ask the gym teacher was if I could borrow the gym to do zumba with the kids since they had missed their gym period twice that week... and that I do zumba and kids usually love it. I've done this in a bunch of other schools and it's usually appreciated and fun for everyone. They also said parents had complained and written notes, and that other teachers complained. So Human resources asked them to bring the notes and to bring a written deposit by the gym teacher. 

Surprise surprise, they had 'disposed' of the notes and they said they forgot to contact the gym teacher because they were overloaded. The principal even went as far as to say that 'we were wasting his time.' So the HR woman basically said it wasn't a problem and that she'd just make a phone call because to write a note on a substitute's file is actually very serious because substitutes eventually end up wanting to teach permanently and that a note on their file could make them not eligible to work for them. They looked uncomfortable but what could they do? 

When HR contacted the gym teacher, the phone was loud enough for us to hear him say 'the substitute asked me to have the gym, she never asked me to take her class, but the gym was busy.' The HR lady was clearly not happy and basically said 'well I got everything I need unless you have some solid proof that this substitute actually did something wrong. The principal had this 'wtf' look on his face. The HR lady basically told them that until this case would be solved they wouldn't be able to receive any more substitutes, that she didn't feel comfortable putting any of her staff working in those conditions and that they'd keep in touch. 

And that's that. It was pretty clear to everyone that the secretary had made those claims up, that the principal blindly trusted her and that something is just off. It feels good no longer to have that on my file. For the last two weeks I was only called twice as supposed to every day...

I moved back across the country, and it turns out the job I took was not exactly what I expected. I’m from a pretty rural area, and have landed at what turns out to be a pretty difficult school. We have a lot of violence, crime, etc in our town, and especially in our neighborhood. 

I got a new student about three weeks ago, and he’s seemed pretty quiet and withdrawn, although his refusal to work despite being very bright stood out. Still, he’s been a treat as far as behavior goes. Since I have about 90% of the angry, young boys in our grade, it has been a relief. 

That changed yesterday. Something happened yesterday, and in the middle of a field trip he stood up, threw a bottle at a kid’s face from about a foot away, and then swung at his face in the best punch I’ve seen in twelve and a half years of teaching elementary school. 

Stopping the event was fairly difficult. My school seems to stress only having people that have been trained restrain students, so I tried my best to keep him from attacking the other student by standing in front on him and not letting him get by. This resulted in my being punched in the chest and sides several times.  When he ducked under the table to get away and go after the student again, I finally decided just to wrap his arms around his body and hold him still while trying to get him to calm down. 

I’m a pretty large guy, and this fourth grader shouldn’t have made any impact on me, and at the moment I didn’t notice anything. By the time the evening rolled around, though, I was fairly sore in my chest and sides. Today has been even worse.

Has anyone else been attacked by a student? This kid seems to have a fairly rough life, and the last thing I want to do is be another person to quit on him or make life harder. I’m just not sure how it is going to be when he comes back to school. I’m not sure how to keep my feelings out of my interactions with him. I’m having difficulty letting it go. 

Overall, the thing at my school that gets to me the most is how angry a lot of the kids are. The constant bickering, name calling, fighting, and general nastiness are so draining. Any suggestions from those in a similar setting?

Thanks for letting me vent.

“If I don’t do it, nobody else will,” she thought to herself as she threw the covers off and rolled out of bed. 

The persistent beeping of the alarm on her phone reminded her that she needed to leave in promptly 45 minutes. Hurriedly, she showered as her husband woke their daughter and got their morning started. As she hopped out, her husband came into the bathroom wiping sleep from his eyes. 

“Morning,” he yawned.

“Good morning. How did you sleep?”

“Meh, I think we need new pillows. Ours are turning colors and poking me.”

“Yeah, I think they’re growing things. That’s what I get for buying the cheap ones,” she leaned in for a quick kiss after braiding her hair and throwing on some clothes.

“Why are you in such a hurry this morning?”

“I have students coming in for tutorials and about 89 essays left to read before grades are due at 4 today,” she replied as she stepped into her shoes. 

“Ah, well don’t work too hard,” he smiled as he smacked her butt in a loving, playful way.

“Mmmhmm,” she muttered as she checked the time on her phone, “I’ll be home early though.”

“Mama!!!!!” A scream penetrated her ears and she dropped the papers she had been gathering.

Her eyes widened and she bolted toward the door.

“ANNA,” she yelled, “Are you okay??”

Her four year old sulked toward her, shoulders slumped, visibly sobbing clutching something in her hand.

“What is it baby?” she persisted.

“H..h...e...he...he’s d...de..de...dead,” she finally muttered through the sobs.

“Oh, who is dead, love?”

“P...ph...ph...Phil…” she thrust out her hands and opened her fingers to reveal the lifeless goldfish to her mother.

“Oh baby, what happened?”

“I...I...I...wanted to let him sleep in a real b..b..be..bed…” she broke off into uncontrollable sobs.

“Wait, you wanted Phil to sleep with you?” her face contorted as she restrained a smile while simultaneously forcing a cough so as not to give way to the fit of laughter that was bubbling so close to the surface.

“Anna, fish sleep in water. They cannot breathe like people. He can’t be out of his tank.”

“But he doesn’t have a bed, mama. He can’t sleep without a bed. Did I kill him, mama? Did I kill Phil?”

“Oh baby…” her voice trailed off. There was not enough time to talk through the never-ending cycle of questions about life that followed the sudden death of a family pet. Her students were expecting her. “We will discuss this after school today, okay? You have to get ready for your class party. Let’s put him somewhere safe, so we can have a funeral this afternoon. We will talk all about Phil’s life and how these things happen tonight. How does that sound?”

“Can we get a new Phil?”

Closing her eyes and admiring her daughter’s ability to bounce back from tragedy so quickly, she smiled and sighed, “Of course, my love, of course.” She brushed her daughter’s cheek lovingly with her fingertips. “I have to get to work, little bit. I’ll see you at your party, alright?”

“Okay, mama, don’t forget to bring the cupcakes. You promised sprinkles,” She sniffled and wiped her eyes, “If you don’t bring them, nobody else will.”

“Of course!” She replied as she entered an alarm into her phone to remind her to leave work early enough to pick up the cupcakes. “1:45 should do it,” she thought to herself.

She kissed her daughter’s cheek swiftly and squeezed her gently.

“Will, I’m leaving!”

“Bye babe! See you this evening. You’re getting Anna, right? I have a meeting Downtown after lunch.” 

“Yes! See you this evening. By the way, there was an accident. Phil is in a plastic baggie on the table, can you...uh...put him in the fridge or something until I get home.”

The curiosity in his voice was evident as he choked out, “Uh…”
“Just don’t ask questions!” She shouted back as she choked back the giggles again.

“Yes ma’am! Love you!”

“I love you more!” She shouted as she headed out to the garage.

    The bell to release students from second period to third period rang, and she bolted out the door. 

“Gotta pee, gotta get coffee. Gotta pee, gotta get coffee. Gotta pee, gotta get coffee.” She chanted as she darted toward the faculty bathroom. One turn of the handle and she realized that the bathroom break was pointless during this passing period. “Gotta get the coffee, gotta get the coffee, gotta get the coffee.” She threw the door open to the teacher’s lounge, nearly knocking a student teacher over. “SO SORRY LESLIE!!”

“It’s okay, Julie! Are you okay?”

“Yes! You know how it is, the bathroom is oc…”

“Occupied? Oh my gosh! All day long. I know it! I just put a new pot of coffee on.”

“Child, I could hug you right now, but your hands are full, so I won’t! Are you all testing again?”

“Ugh. Yes, Mr. Mathers got the post-assessment results and was not happy, so we redid the entire Pre-Algebra Unit.”

“I am just not a numbers person! I don’t know how you all do it. You’re probably stuck with a class full of writers!”

“We flew through the lesson. They’ll get it; it’s just going to take another round.”

“Ahh, good luck, and God Bless you for the coffee!”

“Happy Tuesday!”

She reached the coffee pot and smiled a thankful smile. 

As she poured the coffee, she created a mental checklist of the things left to do today. There weren’t quite as many papers to grade, but still plenty to keep her busy. She had one parent conference over lunch, and then her sub would show up at 1:30 to review the rest of the day’s lesson. She hated to leave her students, especially amidst all the projects and research papers that they were working on, but they’d begun running like a well-oiled machine the last couple of weeks. No matter how many years she had been doing this, there was nothing, short of Anna’s accomplishments, that made her glow with pride like the moment that her students found the road to their success.

Each students’ success story looked differently, but there was no denying when they took their first step down that path. It was rare that an entire class would start on their journeys to success at the same time, but as the year drew to a close, more and more students found their way.  It was that time of the year that she could finally spend less time reviewing expectations and more time helping them find out how to take their work to the next level. She spent less time chasing down missing papers and more time filling out recommendations for Honors’ programs or community achievement awards. She was making less phone calls home to talk about concerns and more calls home to praise her students. It was past Christmas, but THIS was the most wonderful time of the year.

After stopping back by the restroom one last time, she headed back to the room taking the route that passed the faculty bathroom one last time. Singing silent praises as the door opened with ease, she rushed to take care of business and get back to the classroom. 

Half-way through fifth period things changed. 

The day was flying by, and she had not realized how late it was. The substitute had emailed and said he would be late. She sent a quick text to the room mom asking if she could pick up cupcakes for Anna’s party stressing the importance of rainbow sprinkles with the added promise of girls’ night and wine, and then dove back into class. After finishing their warm-up, her never quiet room was filled with extra excitement on this day. Her students had collaborated with the advanced art class to do a cross-curricular project. It was the culmination of weeks of hard-work, and the positive energy passing from student to student moved quickly through the room.

Until it didn’t.

A violent burst of sequential pops erupted in the distance. For a moment there was silence. Not the silence of a house with a toddler sleeping. Not the silence of a theater in the moment between the end of an amazing movie and the start of the credits. Not the silence that takes hold of the room when guests wait for “I do,” from the bride and groom.

This silence was life-changing. This silence was life-threatening.This silence was life-ending.

In that silence, 28 pairs of eyes that had not lived a full life looked at her. 

Seconds passed. Three more bursts. Louder. 

She looked at her students and to the ones closest to the window she said in a firm but pleading voice, “You three, close the blinds.” Her voice wavered but did not falter as she scanned the room for items to use as a barricade she glanced at the clock.

The red dots blinked angrily on the black pixelated background. 

1:40.

“Anna…” her heart ached. Her heart stopped. Her heart broke.

Seconds passed. One more burst.

The sound was getting louder. 

The sound was getting...closer.

Turning on her heels as calmly as possible, she uttered,  “We are in lockdown mode, as soon as I close the curtain, shove all the desks in front of the door.”

“Breathe in, breathe out,” she told herself as she rushed to the already locked door to pull closed the makeshift curtain she’d crafted in August. She reached the window, grasping the cloth desperately she hesitated as she saw two panicked students frantically moving through the hall. Throwing the door open, she grabbed them, threw them inside the classroom and slammed the door shut.

Seconds passed. Three more bursts.

“Why haven’t they made an announcement?” she thought. 

“Flip those two tables over on their sides and everyone behind them,” unsure of how the words were making their way from her brain out her mouth, she continued to stay in motion. It was not fight or flight. She had no fight in her. It was sheer survival mode. 

The two long tables joined perpendicularly in the corner of the room creating an impromptu fort; desks, bookshelves, chairs, and a toppled filing cabinet created a bumpy terrain in front of the door in effort to slow down any intruder. Books littered the floor, and art projects and poems were scattered across the room. In the blink of an eye, prized possessions and priorities turned into trash and debris covering what was now a battlefield.

Seconds passed. Two more bursts. 

This time there was a faint pinging sound that accompanied the shots. The ping of a used shell ejecting and hitting a locker clattering as it hit the tile. For the first time, she heard screams. Blood-curdling, heart-wrenching screams. The wall behind them shuddered creating an instinctive and collective gasp from them all. 

Seconds passed. One more burst.

Her children huddled together, the tears flowing, the muffled sobs as friends embraced. Students texted their families asking questions, but so many messages hung in that place between sent and delivered making the moments feel like days.

She sat closest to the door holding a student’s hand who sat praying in an undertone slightly behind her. The peach fuzz just making its appearance on his face. 

Behind her sat a girl who had spent the previous day hanging posters, hoping for votes for Student Council President. 

Behind her sat a girl who’d just competed in the One Act play with the school. They got third and on Friday the were to perform for the school.

Behind her sat a boy that had just moved to the area. His parents divorced suddenly, and he’d just started actively participating in class discussions.

Behind her sat a boy that was obsessed with science and had read every book on Space that he could get ahold of and that stood up for people that couldn’t stand up for themselves.

Behind her sat a girl, the cheerleading captain, who ran a welcoming committee for new students.  Her laugh could light up a room and her green eyes actually twinkled.

Behind her sat a girl that possessed a quiet fortitude. She was generous and kind with an amazing sense of humor that she reserved for only a select group of people.

Behind her sat a girl that had gotten in a fight with her mom before she left for school that day. The girl came to her that morning in tears because she couldn’t seem to figure out how to just communicate with her mom even though they tried so hard.

Behind her sat a group of children that had not lived their lives.

Behind her sat a group of children that had not seen the world.

Behind her sat a group of children that had so much still to contribute to the world.

Behind her were future doctors, explorers, engineers, researchers, writers, artists, entertainers, rescue workers, counselors, and teachers.

Seconds passed. One more burst.

The sound reverberated through her core as she heard the glass shatter and the handle turn from the inside. He stepped inside, and it was immediately evident that their minefield of furniture was no more disarming than a toddler’s jungle gym.

A second passed. One more burst as he shot in a spray around the room. The sobs were no longer muffled. The screams were not reserved, and the tears were flowing hysterically. Instantly she realized that the hope she had invested in their table fortress was not enough to protect them from the insanity that stepped into their school that day. Help was not coming fast enough. She was the only help they had.

As she stood, ready to take action, she could not help but look at the clock.

1:45.

“If I don’t do it, nobody else will,” she thought as she shoved the closest desk toward him. 

She heard an eruption of shots. 

“The police are here,” she thought as the darkness enveloped her.

I was given an Unsatisfactory grade with 4 days left. I failed for a number of reasons - illness and personal - and bc of this I was not getting work done, revised, or turned in on time. 



I lost a lot of confidence in myself as a teacher and opted not to do the 2nd placement at this time.



My professor will email this week with my options to graduate. 



Is it common to fail? I was a straight A student. I had teaching experience. But issues I struggle with - disorganization, procrastinating, difficulty planning long term, etc - made things nearly impossible. 


My school says I can seek certification later on through alternative means, but I’m not really sure what that means, or if it’s not as “good” as the usual pathway. I wouldn’t mind doing Americorp or something


Any help would be appreciated. I don’t disagree with my coteacher’s assessment. I know I fucked up big time and I’m trying to accept that. I’m just trying to figure out where to go from here.

I'm considering making a mid-career switch to become a media specialist at the elementary or middle school level (I'd be 40 when I start teaching...I'll need to get my teaching license and school library certificate or masters first, which is going to take me around 4 years of going to school part-time while continuing in my full-time job). I have a solid, well-paying job in publishing right now, but I've been mulling over this career change for about 2 years, and despite all logic, it's something that won't go away. I think what's keeping me from taking the plunge, other than having to pay for school and start over at an entry-level salary after almost 2 decades of being in the workforce, is that I'm nervous that I won't be able to find a job. I'm unable to relocate (we have 2 school-age children and are firmly planted here). So I'm wondering...what are your thoughts on the job outlook for school librarians/media specialists? I've read conflicting reports on it--some people say it's going to be an increasingly important role due to technology &amp; digital literacy, other people say librarians are the first to go when administrators have to make cuts. If it's helpful, I'm based in Minnesota.

TL;DR: I want to go back to school to begin a second career as a school librarian/media specialist. Will there be jobs available in 4 years?

Thank you! And thanks for all the hard work you do every day as teachers.

EDIT: I've been volunteering in my kids' school (K-4) for the past year in both the library and the classroom, and I absolutely love it.

I've been a software engineer since the mid 1970's. At that time, I finished about 3 years of college, and then life happened. No need to go into the details, but I never finished my degree. At that time, programmers were almost non-existent. I began writing software, and never needed a degree.

Fast forward over 45 years, and I'm tired of programming for the man, and would like to start a second career. For a long time, I've had a desire to give back what I've learned over the years. I enjoy teaching and working with young people. I've taught a few classes as an adjunct instructor at the community college.  I'd like to become a STEM teacher at the middle school or high school level. I wouldn't mind relocating to a more rural area.

Other hobbies and interests that lead to STEM topics are: I'm a private pilot, an extra-class amateur radio operator with significant electronics experience, and a scuba diver.

Without a degree, is there any hope of getting hired as a secondary teacher? Would I have to go back to school and get a bachelor's or master's degree? If so, the whole thing falls apart just due to the time involved.

You'd think being at that age AND paying for their education, they put in the work! But they don't.

They forget their books, their homework, they don't prepare what I give them to prepare, they come in late or don't come at all.

Normally, in any other class I'd give students detention or deduct points from their grade but their grades don't count until their final exam in a year and their presence doesn't count either.

So I have no leverage AT ALL.


I thought, since they're all adults, I may just bring in a piggy bank and they have to pay something like 50 cents for forgetting things and at the end of the course they get the money and can spend it on something like dinner for everybody or something. But I'm not sure that's allowed. Bringing in cakes or similar isn't something I want because they'd have to bring in a lot of cakes and that's not good from a health standpoint.

Can anyone offer perspective?,"I'm completely burnt out in my current placement.  I've been teaching high school English for 2 years.  I'm debating whether to seek a position at a different high school or to leave teaching altogether.

I love teaching.  I really love it.  But I hate what teaching has done to my personal life and my family.  I work until 5 every day, pick up my daughter from daycare, and work for 1-3 hours in the evening after she falls asleep.  I work Sundays.  But I'm still barely keeping my head above water.

My question is this: is my workload at my current position unusually high?  If so, I will readily find a new placement and continue teaching.  If not, I think that my aspirations of work/life balance are incompatible with teaching. 

Here's my situation:
English courses at my school are semester long.  I teach 6 classes per semester (3 80 minute periods per day on an alternating schedule).  I have 5 unique preps.  I have approximately 130 students per semester.

Over the course of this year alone, I have taught 8 unique English courses (many of them Junior/Senior electives): Freshman English, Interpersonal Com, Expository Writing, Bible and Myth, Fantasy and Sci-fi, Outdoor Life, English Writers I, and Folklore.  I have taught 11 different courses over the past 2 years.

I enjoy learning and teaching new content.  But I find that I dump all of my time and effort into curriculum planning and prep, leaving little time to grade the 390 essays I collect each semester (we have a 3 essay per student per semester minimum).

This is my first teaching placement.  I feel very strongly that this workload must be unusual, but I simply don't have the experience to say that with confidence.

I need practical advice: if I apply at a different school, will I most likely find a more manageable workload?

My mentor teacher has me so disheartened and doubting my ability to teach...,"So, I’m currently in a graduate program. It’s a language program, not necessarily centered on teaching, but I picked it based on the opportunity to get teaching experience. Most people in my program are continuing on to get a PhD and want to do research, I’m here because I want to teach this subject at the middle/high school level.

&amp;nbsp;

I started out taking a pedagogy course, absolutely loved it, did practice lesson plans in class and felt fairly confident. I was paired with a mentor teacher, my mentor is the only one from the country where the language we teach is spoken. It *is* a country that, according to the stereotype, has a lot of rude people. I don’t think that’s the source of the problem though, I spent two months in that country, didn’t have trouble communicating and people were perfectly sweet and encouraging.

&amp;nbsp;

Right off the bat, I felt like an annoying burden. This teacher already does a lot, and seems constantly exasperated by having to mentor me. The first semester things went ok, I taught one segment of classes, got a lot of criticism, but since I was getting positive feedback from pedagogy class too, I still felt ok. My mentor teacher has said a few times she doesn’t really buy the sort of pedagogy we studied, and I noticed that in her teaching. (Although when our director observed her, her lesson plan was totally different than it normally is, following the model we were taught in class).

&amp;nbsp;

This semester on days when I do teach, it’s the full class time. Time management is my biggest struggle, I get stressed about finishing, and I really am trying to work on that. However, my mentor sits in the back of the classroom and makes these **awful** faces as I’m teaching. She’ll furrow her brows and shake her head like my exercise didn’t make sense, even though she looked over my powerpoint before. She’ll shake her head, rub her temples, exaggeratedly sigh, mutter under her breath. Sometimes she’ll write something angrily and then underline it really hard, but a lot of times she loses those notes before we meet again. All of this totally destroys any confidence I have, and makes me more anxious or hurry or change something.

&amp;nbsp;

She gave me a big stack of papers to hand back before the students left, I was nervous about getting it done in time so as they were working on a speaking exercise, I handed them out (about 10 minutes before the end of class). She pulled me aside, sighed and said the rest of class is useless because I handed the tests back. Which I get, I should’ve waited, so I tried to reel them back in by previewing their homework, but she shook her head through that too.

&amp;nbsp;

She told me exasperatedly that it’s fine, because I’m sure she saw on my face how distressed I was and said she knows she makes faces but it’s because she wants to help. I managed to force a smile and sneak up to my office before I broke down and cried. My good friend/office mate was there and heard me out, she told me I absolutely need to talk to the director. I think I will, but I don’t know what to say other than that this has me questioning my ability to even teach, and next semester I’ll be an instructor of record. A semester and a half of feeling like I can do no right has just come crashing down on me, I’m *dreading* teaching Monday, and meeting with my mentor to hear how awful last class was. If she has anything positive to say at all, it feels very patronizing and insincere but I don’t know if that’s just me projecting. Or if this is a culture difference problem, or me just being too sensitive, or just not being good enough.
I guess I’m just looking for insight, I’m feeling so disheartened and questioning whether I’m totally in the wrong line of work. Has anyone else had an experience like this?

I'm looking to go back to school for a Master's In Teaching in Secondary Ed and a question I keep getting from family/friends/acquaintances is whether I'd be able to handle a room full of teenage students. I know that in reality I won't know for sure until I start student teaching, but it's definitely a nagging concern of mine too. I do ultimately feel confident that I'll be able to handle it once the time comes. I've had to handle college-age interns during my time as a graphic designer in the WNBA and have no issue with being supportive and/or stern when I need to be. But of course in reality, a high school classroom and college-level internships are two very different things.

I guess my fear is that I'll go back to school and get overwhelmed and fall on my face once student teaching comes around.

So for those of you who started switched your career to education, how were you able to learn classroom management? How were you able to answer the ""will you be able to handle it?"" question before or during your time in school?

I recently graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder with and engineering degree and a secondary science teaching license (I just finished my student teaching a couple weeks back). A little about my background: I'm a white middle class male who grew up in the suburbs of Denver.

Graduating was a big achievement for me... but, as a white middle class male who grew up in the suburbs, getting my STEM degree wasn't exactly breaking any barriers. Unfortunately, I found that *most of my peers weren't breaking barriers either.* My fellow graduates generally looked like me and acted like me. Worse still, this is a general trend in the US. According to the National Science Foundation, 84 percent of the STEM workforce in the US are white or Asian males (you can read a little more about that [here](https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2015/05/5-numbers-explain-stem-diversity-matters-us/) if interested). There is a enormous underrepresentation of women and minority groups in STEM fields.

This led me and a group of my peers at my university to found a startup, EdBoard Technologies, that is aiming to promote an identity and sense of competency in STEM for elementary school students of all backgrounds. **We are currently looking to interview parents, teachers, school administrators, and anyone who is interested so that we can learn more about the market and how our product would be received.** We can do interviews in person if you live in the Denver/Boulder area or over phone, Skype, etc. if you live elsewhere.

Just me, and the principal. 

I don't think it'll be that different, but I'm now nervous that my previously interactive lesson will now just be a presentation. 

This is the first demo lesson that I've taught, and I'm just envisioning the principal watching and taking notes without engaging. Does anyone with experience giving demos to administrators have any advice? 

Should I cut the worksheet/individual exercise portion of the lesson? They've given me 30 minutes, but I'm nervous about meeting that with such minimal opportunity for any back and forth.

Advice needed,"I am entering my fourth year as an ELA teacher in a relatively small high school. Before going back to school, my wife and I had our first child so I was able to (luckily) spend a lot of time with them this summer that normally fathers do not get.

When I got back to school, I was told I have a brand new prep and the grade I like to teach is being taken away from me.

I felt like a somewhat successful teacher, but now I'm overwhelmed with not knowing what to do all over again. On top of that, I feel like I have some really low-level, non-enthusiastic students (even my honors students admittedly don't like to read or write -- in a damn honors English class ... smh).

I feel like I fight the same battles every year and the victories aren't really victories at all. It's hard to balance prepping a new course, taking care of my family, and finding sleep/happiness/meaning in between.

Don't get me wrong: I've had good teaching experiences before. However, they're small instances, small occurrences. I'd say if I were to give a percentage, roughly 10-15% of the time teaching is fun. Everything else is procedural, test-oriented, state-mandated b.s. 

I'm wondering if anyone else felt this way (almost defeatist attitude honestly) when trying to balance family / teaching career? I am very much considering job searching in Dec. if I don't get some sort of sign (and I'm not a very religious person, I just need affirmation that this is what I need to do with my life or if it's best for my family and my sanity to move on).

Completely new teaching area.,"Hey guys, I need a little guidance if you have the time to spare. I know it's the start of the school year and there's a lot going on, but any help you give me is much appreciated. I'm in sort of a unique situation. I previously taught 6th grade science for 4 years but was cut. I've been on the hunt all summer and in desperation (because it was lower paying than expected), I took a position as the full time sub for an all SPED ED/BD school. I don't have my SPED endorsement and this was the only position that didn't require one. My principal told me that I would probably be spending the first week in Room 3 (2-4 graders) as they hadn't filled that position yet. She was confident about hiring someone and I would just shadow that person for a bit before moving on to daily subbing. Out of her two candidates, one showed up to the interview on meth and the other didn't show at all. I've been bequeathed this room for the unspecified future. It's a super opportunity with a raise and the legal/endorsement logistics are being worked out, but basically my principal plans to keep me in there long term. The only problem is that initially I had planned on coming in each day and having my lessons there. I've never planned lessons for a self-contained SPED class for ALL subjects and for kids this young. I don't have a damn clue what I'm doing. And since the school really didn't anticipate this position not being filled, pretty much everyone is too busy themselves to guide me. On top of that, I'm a late hire and still don't have access to a lot of things that would help me plan. I'm going to have to use EasyIEP and write goals and I haven't even seen these kids IEPs yet. I'm flying completely blind. What do I start the year with? How do I differentiate the instruction? What can their academic levels handle? So I'd appreciate even the slightest shred of knowledge you guys could offer: a lesson, a routine, a behavior strategy, bits of wisdom, or a strong cocktail recipe. I don't know how I'm going to do this, but I gotta do it.

I'm currently a freshman in college seeking to get my BA in History. My college offers a 5-year Masters program where I would receive my Masters of Teaching with a concentration in Social Studies Education (for secondary). I've been told many times, however, that social studies is a very competitive field of teaching, so I thought it would make me a better candidate to try for a double major in both History in English. My school doesn't offer a ""double concentration"" (because you need to have an internship in the topic you want to teach along with specific classes), so I was wondering if this is still a good idea or not? Even with an English degree, I would still pursue at least receiving a certification in teaching English.

Should I go for this plan, or would it be better to focus solely on history and take extra classes just to enhance my learning? (It takes about two semesters to complete each degree, and another semester to finish the classes required to enter the graduate school for teaching so I would be completely done with classes after my first semester of senior year, but this would be only with the minimum about of classes required + taking classes during the summer to get the credits in time.)

Thankfully, I don't actually have that much to do. My students each have their own Chromebook in class and I have Google Classroom set up. Other than setting up our work through Forms and lesson prepping, I've definitely streamlined a few things. I no longer have to worry about making copies or organizing all their work into folders since it's all digital. I also don't need to grade because I can set up Classroom to grade automatically for me (and provide the students with feedback, to boot)

Even with less to do, I find myself struggling to do it at home. I'm not necessarily complaining - I think this even helps balance work and personal life.

* How do you go about getting an alternative school job versus a more conventional high school job? 

* Do any schools have foreign languages or is it very basic ""english/math/science""?

* Are there any graduate programs that specialize in this or can you get a job in alternative ed with well, an alternative certification?

This isn’t to say we should outright reject them but I feel as though the issues and concepts being pushed in those works could be just as well served if they were put forth using more relevant works of fiction/nonfiction. Students might enjoy it more and retain more information.

She doesn’t know that I have no interest in being a classroom teacher, and I was too taken aback in that brief moment to explain myself. 

Some background; I have a good relationship with my principal and I think she likes me, but she’s only been in the job since December and I’ve been on maternity leave most of that time. She’s a veteran in a network full of inexperienced people (both teachers and admin) and she’s made it clear that she’d be making a lot of changes and bringing in different people. 

I went to a title job because I have a baby and I don’t have time for all the outside requirements of a classroom teacher (and my school requirements are particularly ridiculous on top of what every teacher experiences.) 

I didn’t take it as a punishment or demotion, but I assume she probably has an outside contact in mind who is more experienced. She probably doesn’t realize that I feel so strongly about not wanting to be in a classroom and doesn’t realize that I’ll leave if being a classroom teacher is my only option. I don’t know if this would make a difference to her, but the ease with which she brought it up makes me think she didn’t think I’d mind. 

I am trying to decide how to talk with her about this. I’d love to be able to stay at my school where I’ve developed relationships with students and teachers. I would be willing to teach a specials class (I have some informal teaching experience in art) and have even thought about becoming an instructional aid (but I don’t think I could afford the pay cut.) 

If classroom is my only option, I will leave. But, I was really looking forward to having the summer and future summers with my daughter. I know there are plenty of non-school jobs that teachers can get, but I’ve had no luck doing this in the past. I have very few professional connections. 

I’d love to be able to do something from home or part-time, but again, I don’t know if I can afford it. I don’t make THAT much now, however (40k), so I suppose it’s more feasible than if I was the main breadwinner. 

I’m also feeling defeated because I relocated 3 years ago and since moving, have never felt like I had a career. I was just beginning to feel this year like I had some stability and could add on to my foundation, but now I feel like whatever happens, I’ll be starting over - again. 

I just wasn’t expecting this and I’m feeling really lost.

I don't know what to do, my stomach is in a knot, I don't want to get fired. 

Today I saw student 1, student 2, student 3 and another individual who I couldn’t identify using a Juul device in the parking lot around 12:00 in the afternoon. This occurred on 4/17 a couple of hours before their baseball game against other High. They were in a red/maroon SUV. I had just returned from a six mile run and I was tired and walking around the parking lot when I heard a voice calling me over. This was student 2, he started the conversation by asking what I was doing in the parking lot and by asking why I was wearing a blue beanie. He then asked,” do you care if I hit my juul”. I assumed he was kidding given the brazen nature of the question and given the serious consequences for this. I then said “I don’t care”, thinking that there was no way on Earth they would have the guts to do this. To which both him and student 1 proceeded to use the device. At this point I knew I had to report this. I regret saying that I didn't care as it was said sarcastically and I truly did not think that they would show such a lack of respect for me by actually doing that. I am not sure what else to say other than that this is how these events played out. My only regret is that I said I didn't care because I very obviously do care otherwise I would not be sending you this email. If you have any more questions for me I am available Wednesday, Thursday and Friday morning of this week to go over this as well as when school returns. 

I am shitting my pants, I dont know what to do its april vacation, If i tell my students give me shit. If I dont and it gets back to the administration I lose all professional credibility. I feel like Im going to break down over the stress Im having over this. Please help me.

#Teachers have no reason to complain about their wages. Should have chose a different career, nobody forcing you to be a teacher. Some teachers requirement is literally only that they need to have patience and be smarter than a kindergartener. Teachers get Summer and christmas off, as well as most other holidays like thanksgiving and spring break. 

#Yet they act like they aren't being payed enough. How fucking pathetic is that. What a joke. Teachers really should be paid minimum wage, test scores would be the same and the kids would be just as disciplined as they are now.

So I tried the VR headset with the Google Expedition app and it's amazing! I definitely want to use it for my unit plan about the solar system. So I was wondering if any of you guys have already tried virtual reality in your classrooms?

TL;DR, two years ago I got a job in a relatively rural High School close to DC as a Social Studies teacher. That being my first year, I messed up on alot of things and I was not rehired. In fact I was forced to resign (not sure what the difference is). 

I thus decided to take a year off, go back to school and take some science classes and try to figure my life out. Now that university classes are over, I want to go back to teaching. With the experience and age, I think I can do better. What should I do?

I would like to move to NY, PA or NJ and teach there. Should I start this year by long term subbing in my area then next year applying for a full time position in one of those states I would like to move to? 

Another question is, how do I handle the fact I was not rehired? When I list my old school as a reference, will my old boss say I was not-rehired and forced to resign? 

Finally, my plans are to get certified in Biology and ESOL then doing a bad ass job as a long term sub so I can bag a few decent recommendations from the people I will be working for.

If you have kids and you don't have a VR headset at home, I strongly recommend you take a look at www.starkvrpro.com Stark VR headsets are very impressive. You can e-mail them and they will explain you how it works and how to get VR educational content. It's really simple!

I’m a 31 year old male in CT. Since I was 18 I have been working in Information Technology. I received an Associate’s Degree in General Studies and went no further. Wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do. Six years ago I was considering going back to school to become a teacher but ended up getting the job I am at now. Fast forward to today and I make a decent salary ($55k/yr), own my own house, getting married and all that. But I am so unhappy. I never wanted to be in IT as a career. Especially Corporate IT. I work 3rd shift and the work is completely unsatisfying and uninteresting to me. In the back of my mind, and really now the forefront of it, I keep going back to wanting to be a teacher.

When I think about my life, some of the best times were elementary school. I still remember all my teachers, and many of the lessons they imparted on me helped me become who I am. I think even back then I wanted to become a teacher but I was either unsure or trying to “be cool.” Now I’m wanting to give back and help form young minds. I also love teaching kids how to read and write when I can. I have done some tutoring in college for English/Creative Writing classes and loved it. 

I know the landscape for teachers isn’t painted as attractive or great in the media. I know it’s hard work. I’m not afraid of that. I guess I’m afraid of not being a good teacher and not being able to find a job. Also how long it might take me to get a bachelor’s degree and find work.

I know New York had a safety net test, and that safety net is expiring at the end of this June. I don't think I can get the test completed, and have it graded by the cut-off for the safety net test. 


I desperately want to start my teaching career, but I'm not sure how to go about getting certified at this point. So here are the options I was thinking of:

1.Moving to a state with easier certification requirements. (I was thinking of moving anyway.) If I did this, what states have programs that would allow me to (easily) get certified with a degree from a different state?

2.Trying to find a way to pass the EdTPA with what I have already. What can I do to make this work? Am I just being too harsh on myself? 


I'm pretty anxious about the whole thing. It's been a few years since I did that lesson, and I can see a lot of flaws in it.  I wish I could go back and do this all over again, but I'm stuck with what I have now. Teaching was something that truly made me very happy, and I would be crushed if I  couldn't do it because of this test.

I would like to seek some advice. I am interested in switching careers, and am looking at the idea of becoming a history or social studies teacher in particular. 
My initial forays into researching the idea suggest New York (where I currently live) or Massachusetts would be good places based on pay, a vague sense of the job market being better due to being higher population states, and the fact that, since I already live in the northeast, it would be less disruptive to my living situation than moving to, say, California, if I pursue teaching certifications. I have a bachelor's in Arabic and because of the economy's poor state when I graduated college, I took work where it is an irrelevant skill because I needed the money, and my Arabic skills are rustier than I would like them to be. 

So my questions are:
1. does anyone have advice on what colleges in NY or Mass would be good to try and get into? I live between Buffalo and Syracuse, so obscure schools that are hidden gems are welcome suggestions, as well as ones in NYC, Hudson river valley, Boston area, etc.
2. How weird is my bachelor's background going to look in this context? I have a decent number of social studies relevant undergraduate coursework because of general education requirements plus some history and anthro-style courses which fit into my major. I am open to taking more if it helps me out here.
3. Broad level advice: I have heard about trying out substitute teaching and stuff like that, so what is your weirder advice for people looking to change careers as an adult, or what other career options would you suggest for someone who finds teaching history attractive?",false,8c48bd,,0,,false,1529590140,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/8c48bd/considering_pursuing_teaching_career/,t3_8c48bd,,,,

I am completely unsure of how to respond for a few reasons. This student has been an absolute nightmare this entire year. He screams at me on a weekly basis, has thrown objects ranging from pencils and paper to hard novels and his electronic device, and he does absolutely no work in my class. He is very violent. I also know that this student’s family owns a rifle shop. I am sure I am thinking too negatively, but he scares me. 

Not to toot my own horn, but I am fairly attractive and young. I am used to students crushing on me. This is nothing like those situations. To preface, I have forwarded the email to admin but I doubt they will get back to me this weekend. I just don’t know how to respond in fear of responding wrong in the eyes of this child. I am terrified that he will be angry if I completely ignore the email or if I tell him that teachers cannot text their students. He won’t be able to understand that that is wrong. I also am nervous for how he will act in class. I always feel like he gets too close but gave him the benefit of the doubt because he’s 11 and kids just do that stuff. Now, I think differently.

1527706123,teaching,teacher__throwaway,self.teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/8nb4it/considering_moving_for_teachinghelp_ncscoh/,3,1,1,0,Considering moving for teaching...HELP! (NC/SC/OH),"Hello! This may get to be long, and I am posting this on a throwaway, but I'd appreciate if anyone could help.

I'm originally from Ohio and live in Ohio currently. I am an intervention specialist \(which is what Ohio calls special education teachers\). My license is K\-12 Intervention Specialist, Mild/Moderate.

Prior to my current job, I taught for 6 years in NC. In NC, I was licensed in K\-12 Exceptional Children \(special ed\), K\-12 reading, 4\-9 math, and eventually, school counseling as well because I earned 18 credit hours in that but never finished the degree.

When I moved back to Ohio, the only license that Ohio would give me here was my K\-12 ISMM. I cannot add any of the other items unless I take a lot more credit hours and Praxis tests \- more on that in a minute.

In the time between teaching in NC and moving back to OH, I went through a divorce and worked another job not in education at all, which made me decide to get an MBA and I graduated with that almost a year ago but I am working at a charter school as a special education teacher. I am now interested in teaching career\-tech education such as business, marketing, or computers. However, in Ohio the way it works to get licensed for that is, you have to get the job \*and then\* apply for the license, not the other way around. I confirmed this with a principal of a career\-tech program that I know pretty well. Ohio has it structured that way because typically, people in those roles get hired out of industry instead of being teachers already in another content area. It's not impossible to get hired having gone my route BUT openings are rare because Ohio is one of the higher paying states for teachers so people don't leave often.

Because of all this, I have considered moving to SC or even back to NC in the next few years. In NC I could get all those other license areas back, plus they'd hopefully give me career tech with my MBA \(still need to call their DPI to confirm\). The only thing I don't like is that the pay is going to be low. I think SC pays slightly better than NC, but when I researched adding business/marketing technology to my license, they require courses I didn't get with my MBA \(surprisingly!\) or as electives within my bachelor's degree. They want an entrepreneurship class, 6 more computer apps credit hours than I have, a hospitality management class, and an international business class and a couple others. I would need 18 MORE credit hours on top of my MBA in order to get their business teaching license which is just absurd to me, when I have an MBA. :\( However, in SC they'd definitely give me special ed. The worst thing of all is, I own a small business on the side, which is way better entrepreneurship experience than a class could give, but I digress. And then in Ohio it's even worse, if I wanted to add on, say, middle grades or HS math, I'd need close to 30 additional math credit hours, even though I did a finance concentration for my MBA which clearly shows competency with Algebra I, II, and even Geometry when you look at the analytical skills needed.

So, I am trying to decide if taking those additional credit hours would be worth it should I decide to make the move to SC in a few years? Even if I take them, it doesn't guarantee I'd get that kind of teaching position. When I lived in NC, I tried to get out of special ed since I had all those other license areas and I couldn't. I interviewed a ton for regular positions instead of sped, but the principals kept calling me back and saying ""Hey, so we filled the reading/math/counselor job, but I do have a special ed opening still if you want it.""

I really do want to exit special ed EVENTUALLY even if it's not now \- so I would appreciate any advice on how to convince administrators to give me a chance in a gen ed job too, assuming I can get that kind of license wherever I end up. NC I definitely can, and SC I would plan ahead to have my ducks in a row so I have everything correct before I apply for jobs.

My dream jobs in order, no matter where I live, would be:

1\) Career\-tech teaching business/marketing/computers

2\) MS or HS math

3\) Special ed \(but truly only if the options are, unemployment or SPED lol\)

TL;DR is: should I take more credit hours so I am qualified for a dream teaching position in either career tech or math? How do I convince interviewing administrators that I can teach regular ed and to give me a chance to get out of SPED?

She has been working part time teaching an after school program at various local elementary and middle schools.  Now we're looking into what it would take for her to become a full time elementary school teacher. 

In town there is a community college and a state univeristy that both offer a post baccalaureate elementary teaching certificate,  which would allow her to get a teaching license in our state (Arizona).  The program at the state univeristy is much more rigorous and expensive.  But I was worried that having certificate from a community college might hurt her job opportunities.

My questions are.   
Does anyone here have a Bachelor's in something other than teaching, plus a post baccalaureate certificate? And is it hard to find work with those sort of quailifications?

Any advice would be helpful.,"I recently graduated with a BA in History from UCSD, I live in San Diego right now but I'm planning on moving to Oregon to pursue a teaching career there. As far as I can tell, I have a few options.

Option 1: Undergrad Program

2 year program, will get me credential but no “graduate points” or whatever determines payscale, offered all over Oregon, likely the easiest program to get into.

Option 2: Post-Bacc

1 year program, will get me credential and count towards Masters progress at a later date (if I want it), only available at two universities in Oregon. Basically designed for my situation.

Option 3: Masters Program

1 year intensive program/2 year nightly program. Offered pretty much everywhere, but most expensive and (I assume) most competitive. Will start me off at a higher base pay, which would be pretty nice.

------

I've always said I'm not looking for a Masters program right now, but if I'm honest with myself I think I'm mostly just worried that I wouldn't get into one of them. Then again, another two years of really intense school sounds unpleasant and I kinda just want to get into the workforce.

Any thoughts? I feel like the smartest option economically is a MAT but the post-bacc program sounds like it's probably what I should go for...I'm so conflicted and kinda scared, just because I have no idea what I'm doing and don't want to fuck it up.",false,8khb76,,0,,false,1529741410,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/8khb76/not_sure_what_license_program_to_pursue_any/,t3_8khb76,,,,

\(ii\) Human learning;

\(iii\) Teaching methodology;

\(iv\) Inclusion of special needs student populations; and

\(v\) Assessment of students""

I've never interviewed for a job that I *really* want. I've mostly worked retail and then the last few years have been random office jobs. I've also never been good at asking questions during interviews and I know that doesn't necessarily look good.

Does anyone have different types of questions that I can ask?

I teach high school science (10-12 grade) and recently got a sub to cover for me while I’m on paternity leave (2 weeks). I’m 3 days out and from reports from my sub it sounds like my class has devolved into chaos. 

Normally my class is pretty well behaved. The major one in question is mostly juniors and seniors. I have good engagement most days, and have a good relationship with them (at least so I thought). I do have a couple trouble students that are annoying though. 

The first day my sub reported that students weren’t getting work done. It was a couple worksheets, so I didn’t expect much engagement. They were to be homework if not done in class. I didn’t expect students to be wholly on task with a sub, but at least manageable. From the sound of it though, students were playing video games and distracting others, which I’m not ok with. I send out an announcement to the class reminding them not to distract others, and told them specific consequences for doing so. 

Now, 4 days in, apparently someone ripped my ‘rules’ poster off the wall and crumpled it up while the sub was in the bathroom. 

I’m shocked by this. The class is normally so much fun and is well-behaved. Is this the subs fault? Or was I too trusting of my students? Is my class not as good as I thought it was? How do I follow up?

I want to ask the class to anonymously report whoever tore the sign, with a reward for coming forward. I then want to bring the hammer down on whoever did it. This is not how I wanted this break to go.

That being said, the study guides available to purchase online are also pretty expensive and to buy all three, it adds up really quickly. So I thought I would turn here to see if there is anyone that has taken the OAEs that I need to take and would be willing to pass along some of their old study guides/materials. I would be so, so grateful because all of the expenses of going into teaching are starting to get bigger as I get closer to having my own classroom. I currently am having to revamp my wardrobe because I only have like one outfit that's appropriate for teaching, lol. I also have to fork out money for the EdTPA and just the student teaching fee in general, which also sucks. 

So basically long story short, if anyone has materials for the following OAEs that they'd like to pass along, I would be FOREVER grateful:

-Middle Grades Language Arts (4-9)
-Middle Grades Social Studies (4-9)
-Foundations of Reading

I'm basically the type of person who is going to stress about this until I have the final answer. Is it likely that I passed? What could change? Thanks.

I’ve always looked at teaching as a honorable career and if not all majority of the people that have changed my life in a positive way have been teachers. I wanted to switch half through my CM major, but just stuck it out.

I have no clue if my current degree gets me anywhere in teaching. I’m in CA. What’s the path I should take? What do I need to start subbing classes or doing classroom observations?

I am currently a Title I Interventionist/paraprofessional in a high-need district in Indiana (Lafayette-area), looking to transition into an elementary education certification, which has different requirements than the specific area of teaching certifications I have seen mentioned here previously. I have looked into several programs and think I know which one I want to apply to, but I'm hoping to hear some anecdotal stories about your experiences before making any final decisions.

Specifically, has anyone received an emergency permit to teach in Indiana (maybe even in the area), and what were the circumstances? Absolute best case scenario for me would be to begin teaching on an emergency license in the fall, and go through certification requirements while teaching, but I know this might not be possible. I'm just trying to gauge the likelihood of this before bringing it up to my administration. I am very confident they and my classroom teachers would support my transition, and officially recommend me in writing, but I am unsure how 'in need' a district must be before applying for and accepting someone on an emergency license. Our school alone (of I think 9 in the district) is hiring at least 5 full-time teacher positions for the fall, and is not the better-paying district around, so am unsure how confident they are in filling those positions, how long they would wait, etc., before accepting a non-licensed applicant.

Is it something worth bringing up, and if so, how would you recommend approaching it? I don't want to seem as if I am unsatisfied with my job. On the contrary, I love what I do and want to put myself on a path to be able to fully support myself doing it, as my current position is mandated part time by the Title I grant that finances it.

Any experience or knowledge you have would be greatly appreciated! I am mainly trying to gather as much information as I can, both from the IDOE and personal stories, before approaching the principal of school with the request, so any little bit helps, even if it's second-hand.

(As a side note, is the student teaching part of the T2T programs always required, even with classroom experience? Not looking to get out of it, just curious.)

If there's any pertinent information I didn't mention, let me know and I'll definitely share, thank you so much for your help making my dreams come true!

I am a medical lab technologist and am currently also assisting in teaching a group of students that are going through a 1 year internship in an attempt to get a degree and license in order to join the profession.  The license exam is 100 multiple choice questions and is computer adapted to adjust difficulty based on the performance of the person taking it as they progress.

So, I’m giving them a 45 minute to 1 hour presentation on good multiple choice test taking strategies!  I’ve read a few articles published by multiple universities and I believe I have a decent framework but I’d love to get more advice from the professionals; if anyone has any Golden advice or good references/reads they can link to I’d appreciate it.  

My current outline is (approx) 5 minute intro, how these strategies might help as well as outlining their exam format to them in case they haven’t researched it.  10-15 minutes of going through tips and tricks / strategies.  10-15 minutes for them to engage in my mock test that will be questions that almost none would know the answer to, but given these strategies they should be able to deduce many of the answers.  Followed by a 5-10 minute Q&amp;A period which I would guess will go long with students inquiring about their license exam format. 

Currently the bulk of my research suggests...

1. Read and answer each question in your head before reading the options

2. Read all options before selecting a final answer

3. Take notes as you progress through the test, answers can be given away by other questions

4. Eliminate nonsense answers and things you know to be wrong

5. Eliminate answers if they appear as an option twice for one question (if “erythrocytes” is option B and “RBCs” are choice C then neither can be right, as they are the same thing.)

6. In the event you do not know the answer the longest answers are often the correct ones.

7.  In the event you do not know the answer answers with definitive qualifiers are often wrong (definitely, always, all the time...)

8. In the event you do not know the answer Answers with possible qualifiers are often the correct response (sometimes, often, usually...)

That’s the bulk of what I’ve gotten so far.  Appreciate anyone to have taken the time to look this over and anyone with info that might help me better prepare this group for success.

Thoughts on EYFS?","I’ve taught under several curricula but this year is my first on EYFS. I’ve found my self frustrated many times because response to my ideas are often to the effect of “that’s not allowed under EYFS” or “that doesn’t fit the EYFS curriculum”.

Ideas that I’ve proposed included:
- introducing the mencap getarty program for after school clubs
- working one on one with a couple of kids cause they still can’t even hold a pencil at the end of the year and never practice unless with a teacher
- running a whole class craft activity (at Christmas) and doing it all together as opposed to in small groups
- several other well developed resources such as getarty produced within the UK and one science programmed based in the country where I work

What I’m wondering is: is the EYFS curriculum explicitly this restrictive and rigid, or is this just their interpretation of it? Are they being too rigid out of judgement of me because I’m not trained with a PGCE (despite having a BSc in Education 4 years teaching experience and currently studying my master’s) or is it just the way PGCE teachers in the early years are conditioned to think?

EYFS is nice but I do think there are factors of it that aren’t too great and the same goes for other curricula. Isn’t it a positive to borrow positive aspects from several sources if it aids your students learning? EYFS can probably function better in the UK but some of my students don’t even speak English and in an entire academic year still can’t.. I have also taught English before and saw far more progress in this regard through different approaches. I question the effectiveness of the system in preparing for learning at international schools at higher levels solely in English if it also fails to develop these skills? One size doesn’t really fit all especially on a global scale with early years surely?

However, in the years I've been teaching, many videos are: 

* Too long
* Too complicated
* Too fast
* Too clever

My students do not understand or cannot connect to these videos. So, this summer, I'm making my own. 

**What topics do you feel would benefit from having a short, easy to understand, direct to the point video?** I want these videos to be as useful to as many people as possible. 

I’m focusing my efforts mostly on ELA, but I also have a credential in Social Studies.

My professors look at my lesson plans and my professors and mentor teacher say they're well planned lessons but when it comes to actually teaching them it just doesn't go all that great. This is all with a general education class.

My major is special education and I also did my field experience for special ed. It was a resource room setting and co teach and I loved it! In resource room, it was a lot of small group-3 kids, and a lot of 1:1. All my suggestions for improvement in the general ed setting (giving explicit directions &amp; modeling, praising) are all of my strengths in special ed on my evaluation from my professor who went to go watch my teach a lesson in the resource room. I also know in need to find my teacher's voice for a general ed class. I'm very soft spoken and rarely use a firm voice. I don't know if I'll be placed in a special education class or general education class for student teaching. If I do get placed in a general education class I'm just really nervous because I know I'm capable of good teaching with special education, but with general ed it's 20 kids that you have to teach and it was hard for me to do that this semester.

Any advice for student teaching? I feel like it might be easier because I'll be seeing the kids every day (field block experience this semester was only once a week) and I'll know the teacher and the kids more along with knowing how kids react and what they do or don't know.

I've been at my current position for 4 years, and each year I've debated leaving. It has become soul-crushing to work here.  I teach preschool located in a preK-8 grade school, and most of the staff is unprofessional.  We've had multiple staff meetings concerning staff ""putting their hands on the students"". My preschool director has always been a handful, but this year she's also been the lead teacher in another preschool room and she's been out of control.  The most frustrating part is watching her do inappropriate things that I have been reprimanded for in the past.  For example, we must maintain an 8 child-1 adult ratio at all times.  On two occasions just recently, she's left her associate teacher with 10 kids, out of ratio. This was in front of a supervisor that was assessing our program.  I also had to meet with her and two other supervisors last year when I did not complete a required task. (Writing 38 notes each for 16 kids over 3 months, a very frustrating part of the job. I was missing a handful.) My director gave me no notification of the meeting and told me 15 minutes before it was taking place.  This year, she did not enter any notes for her children and to the best of my knowledge received no repercussions.  She knows one of the supervisors personally outside of school, and hired her to be our supervisor, so there might be some conflict of interest. 


That being said, the job does pay well relative to others I've looked into.  I also will be moving in a year with my military wife, who is pregnant with our second child.  I will need to take some time off in January to be with them.



My question is, should I gut it out for another year or finally move on?  And if I do move on, when do I tell the new school I'll be leaving at the end of the year? My biggest concern is leaving and not finding a job after telling them I'll be gone in a year, or not finding one that pays as well as my current one.

I try to incorporate it little by little into bell works and other assignments. 

As I grade their most recent essays, it is becoming pretty obvious that they are never going to master these skills without a lot of emphasis on them. Does anyone have any good approaches for teaching basic grammar to older students? Everything I've found is geared towards much younger grades and they will find it babyish and boring.

Some background: I graduated from UCSB with a Math B.A. and Science and Math Education (7-12th grade) minor in June 2017. I conducted STEM education research my last year, volunteered as a math tutor at various HS, interned my freshman yr as a clinical research analyst, worked through college as an admin asst., and am currently a payroll temp back in SD (hometown). Immediately after graduation, I started an Applied Math M.A. program at SDSU, but dropped out towards the end of the first semester because I felt unsupported, disinterested, and highly stressed (lost weight/hair/meh).

I started my education minor my senior year just so I could stay for the full four years, but the minor had me interested about a career in teaching HS math. I took and passed the CBEST with a high score, but did not pass the CSET math subject tests, so I was unable to apply for my top choice teaching programs (UCSD &amp; UCSB). I also had some reservations about becoming a teacher, considering the budget cuts occurring in education right now and the salary I would have as a CA teacher.

Therefore, I decided to take a temp job while I worked towards my other interest in data science. However, I've realized that I have a lack of experience and schooling in order to enter this field. I'm interested in this field because of the analytical skills used (feel like my degree would be worth it), implications of the data analysis you conduct (improve society/research somehow), and higher pay and job security. So to enter this field, I'd have to take the GRE again (my first score was not great) and get relevant letters of rec (SDSU's program didn't require LOR) and apply to CS or Data Science grad programs. CS programs are an option, depending on the school, because Data Management and Analysis are part of the curriculum, and I think the CS programs would be more versatile in the workforce.

Either path requires more schooling, but different kinds of preparation. I want to be in a position where my work makes a positive difference in society, but I also am afraid of job prospects after completing school, being in more debt for a non-practical degree, and how my standard of living will be. Also, I am young, but I feel very old and like my life and opportunity to start a career will pass me by, esp. since it's already been almost a year since I graduated.

I suppose what I'm looking for from this forum are opinions/experiences of the people who are/were in similar situations (how did you decide what to pursue?) and of the people in these positions (teacher). I'm sorry for the length of this post! I just wanted to be as thorough as possible. Please let me know if there's any more info you need/want.

TLDR: Can't decide between teaching or data science. For CA teachers, how difficult was it to find a job after graduation, and what's an average salary, or the salary I should expect? I looked at salary schedules in the two districts near me, and they seem reasonable, but also not much info on how that salary is decided upon.

Background: I have long term subbed in Middle School GT for 2 years. I just finished my student teaching in a Freshman Honors Biology class. I am now long term subbing Freshman Algebra until the end of the year at the same high school I student taught at. 

This math class is a mess. There are the max number of IEP students and it is co-taught. The original teacher left on medical leave in October. The Co-Teacher left this January. The teacher that replaced the original teacher just left last Friday – and I replaced him. The person that replaced the co-teacher is still there. If you could keep track of that, I am the 5th teacher this year.

The co-teacher I am working with is Italian, from Italy. His accent is thick and is a long term substitute – no education classes. His method of teaching the students is to do math questions quick from bell to bell. He doesn’t pay attention to the students and doesn’t stop if they are misbehaving. He is finishing this unit and I will start teaching on Monday. I should also mention he is hard of hearing. Students try to ask him questions, and it takes a few minutes for him to hear it and respond. 

As you can imagine, the classes are a mess. I came in strong and got 3 out of the 4 classes under control. They don’t talk when he is talking, and they seem to be learning. I help with the small classroom management issues that come up and all is good. The last class, which is the last class of the day, every day, is a disaster. They won’t stop talking and don’t care about their grades. The average grade is a 61%. 

I tried starting with just positive rewards – candy. I know candy isn’t great, but it worked. Then, I started moving students that were talking non-stop. The issue is there is nowhere else to put them and they are all friends. I have tried talking to them logically. They don’t seem to care. I have lowered citizenship grades – they don’t care. I know I need to get rougher, but I am confused at what I should do. I have never had to deal with such a misbehaved class.

The teacher I replaced told me that he just tried his best and kept trying to change the seating chart to make them stop talking. It didn’t work.
 
Any thoughts? Anything is appreciated.

Two potential avenues, both related to teaching, are private tutoring and hosting your own privately-run classes.

So we came up with the designs of a prototype that would make it super easy for teachers to:

* set up a personal website
* schedule private lessons
* build credibility and trust through reviews
* host in-person, privately-run classes
* create invoices and collect payments

We'd like to make it super easy and accessible for teachers to make extra money through what they're already good at–teaching. With private lessons, teachers can charge more per hour ($40-60+) and have complete control over how they teach. Tutoring for an additional 5 hours a week at $40-60 per hour can be an extra $8-12K a year.

You can see the designs of our prototype by [clicking here](https://imgur.com/a/o3mgsvT).

Once it's built, we'd like to charge $2.99 per month with no transaction fees (you keep everything you make.)

We're just about to devote the time and resources to start building this prototype. But first, we wanted to ask if this tool would be useful to teachers, or if we're missing the mark.

We'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback, especially if you're a teacher or tutor that's actively (or looking into) teaching private lessons/classes on the side.

- If you're a teacher, would you be interested in teaching private lessons/classes?
- Would our software be useful to you?

I am a beginning teacher who currently teaches Mathematics at a public high school in New South Wales, Australia. I started this position towards to end of Term One by replacing a teacher who left the position. Although I have been coping with the workload despite being thrown in the deep end, I have come to a conflict with a few of my students.

I have a ""good"" class for year seven where the students have been grouped due to their positive comments from their primary school teachers. Many of these students are a pleasure to teach and interact with due to their continued efforts and diligence, but there are a handful of students who are always slacking off and muck around unless disciplined through constant reminders of why they are at school and what their responsibilities are as students.

The problem occurred today, Monday afternoon, where they come to Mathematics after PE \(Physical Education\). They are exhausted and not bothered to work at all.

The handful of students who slack off and muck around usually whilst I was teaching, complained about how my explanations did not make sense to them and also added that I was a bad teacher since they received poor marks for their Half\-Yearly Examination. Questions arose where these students asked me for which university I graduated from and how long I have been teaching.

I did not react to the situation and moved on with the lesson, but I was personally very offended by the situation. I know kids can be kids, but what they said and implied about myself as a teacher was disheartening, given I put a lot of time and effort to prepare my lessons.

My question is, how should I deal with these students and their attitudes? And also, how can I get these students on board with my and the rest of the class so that they can enjoy my lessons and enhance their performance in Mathematics?

I called the office to have him removed as he was picking a fight with another student. Later on in the period, he left the office without permission and was jiggling the door handles trying to be let in. I don't know why he wanted back in, but it scared me.

That combined with some other things, and he has two days of ISS. I am scared to have him back in my class, especially without first setting the precedent that the way he treated me is unacceptable. This kid has several inches and probably at least eighty pounds on me. Other teachers are recommending I press charges, and I agree.

I was hoping someone could give me some career advice on becoming a teacher in California. I would be starting from scratch as I don't have any credentials whatsoever. Here are a few pieces of information that I feel are important:

**My Background**

Thirty year old male. I graduated with a BA in Geography and a certificate in GIS. It's been some time since I graduated, and I've forgotten almost everything I learned. I was never really happy with my college experience, as I had minimal guidance, wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my degree, and pretty much took courses just to graduate. I haven't really been able to accomplish much with my degree, and am no longer really interested in the field. If I could go back in time I definitely would have done something different.

I do have a brief history of working with kids. I was a former volunteer karate instructor for about five years and taught small and large groups of children from the ages of 5 up to the adult years. I also tutored one of my students in reading outside of the classroom. I was lucky enough to work with children from several different backgrounds and various types of disabilities. I also had the opportunity to volunteer as an education docent at a nature preserve and take classroom sized groups of children on nature walks. A large part of my current job also involves educating the public and providing information.

My brother and sister are both teachers. They both had very different feelings towards the profession. While my brother loves it, my sister had had a bit of a rougher time.

**Goals**

While I have no experience running a classroom, conversations with my siblings have helped me to understand how truly challenging it can be. My sister has said it is one of the hardest things she has ever done. She says I would just be trading one stressful environment for another, but I'm not necessarily looking to get rid of the stress. I'm looking for a sense of purpose that is worth all the stress. I'm also looking to help students who feel lost or are having difficulty as I have some experience with those feelings myself. Simply put, I feel like teaching would help give me a greater chance of having  positive impact on the world.

**Current strategy**

My brother has suggested that I first try and take the CBEST in order to get an emergency license. From there I would begin substitute teaching. If I enjoyed it, I could then leave my current job while subbing in order to gain a more steady work schedule and go back to school. I would like to initially try teaching elementary due to the wide range of subjects, eventually moving on to becoming a science teacher \(possibly earth science or chemisty?\).

I have already bought a CBEST test prep book and plan to start studying it soon in order to take the test and begin subbing. This seems a little too straightforward, though. Does this plan seem right?

My sister has mentioned that her school district is desperate for teachers and is hiring people without any credentials. As she has explained it, you promise the district that you will go to school and become certified as you are teaching.

HS in suburb of large city in the upper midwest. 

Every year my school of 880 makes a budget for staffing the next school year. They base the staffing off of how many students register for next year's classes. For the past few years we have had more and more students taking the PSEO option to go to college while in hs. This past year we had 50, this next year it is looking like 60. 

When making the budget for staffing we have always asked the PSEO kids to register for classes to help our budget, getting more FTE's. I have always thought this was weird that we would base our budget off of fake student registrations since we know and the students know they are taking the PSEO option. 

So here is the bad part. Please take into account I am not smart when reading this. I see the district finance director outside the bathroom one day, his office is in my building. I proceed to explain all of this and question if this is the best way to make a budget. He seems very intrigued, thanks me, and we part ways.

Today the new budget came out and everyone is up in arms. We are basing the FTE's off of the actual students who will be coming in the fall and we are losing 2.8 FTE's. I feel very responsible for this and I don't know how to control my feelings.

Don't know if I can make it through the last two months.,"Posting on a throwaway account (and on mobile, so *insert customary appolgy for formatting here*.) It's also long, so:

TL;DR: I'm enduring daily harrassment from a significant portion of my students. Admin refuses to step in, multiple teachers are becoming physically sick from stress, and I am at an emotional breaking point. Help?

I'm coming up on the end of my first year of teaching. I made the tremendous mistake of accepting a position at a charter school (in mid-town Houston). I thought charter schools were supposed to be a dream to teach in...highly funded, committed to excellence and professional development, pioneering new ideas and techniques...the first year's dream. 

The reality (which I've been told is no secret) is that charter schools are torturous for nearly any teacher, veteran or brand new. My school day is 9.5 hours long (7 am to 4:30 pm if I am only there when the kids are there, and many teachers stay later than that). I get 1 hr of planning time and 20 minutes for lunch, so that's 7 full hours of kids every day. I work every single duty (morning, lunch, and dismissal). I have a homeroom. I do ""interventions"" in another teacher's classroom for an hour each day. I teach 200 students (as an elective teacher). 

I understand that these can be pretty normal for elective teachers, charter school teachers, and first-year teachers. It's tiring, but if I loved what I did, it would still be less hectic than my college years and I'd be fine.

Here's the thing: I hate my school. When I was student teaching, I had *maybe* three kids that I dreaded seeing every day. I expected that number to be higher in a school that serves 95% low-income students (who are accepted based on lottery, regardless of previous accademic or behavioral record). I did not expect for that number to jump to about 30% of EACH CLASS. 

There are simply too many incidents to recount, but I'll list a few:

- A 6th grade student told me he was going to smash our class pet (a bearded dragon) and suggested that I had a sexual relationship with it. 
- A group of 6th grade boys dropped their pants in my room to ""show off their shorts"" (underwear). 
- Students have called me a ""racist"" (or drawn a racist picture of me which labeled me a ""tow-head rich boy"") after being redirected for misbehavior and assigned an in-class behavioral reflection sheet. The kid who drew the picture actually placed it on the projector for all to see on his way out of the room.
- A select few of students come in each day and, in their words, ""try to get kicked out"" for the first ten minutes of class, usually by attempting to break materials, yelling at me during instructions, or knocking over their stools. 
- Some students speak Spanish to admin in front of me when/if they do step in, so I cannot participate in the discussion and my witness does not count toward their consequence. 
- A student sexually harrassed me for three weeks. I documented it and reached out several times to admin for help, who told me to ""address it in class"" and that ""no one else was having this problem."" I had to point out that that meant that he was targeting me before they finally ""conferenced"" with the student. No consequences were assigned. 
- At least twice a week, I am screamed at by a student. Sometimes in passing, in the hallway as they walk by. Sometimes in my room, after asking them to sit down or start their assignment. It happens so often most teachers don't even bother to address it. 

I can't do anything with these students but wait out their abuse. They make up about 30% of the population. There's about 30% that I'd say are ""normal"" 5th and 6th graders that get up to normal middle school shenanigans. The remaining 40% are what I'd call the ""tough kids"" I remember going to school with myself. Disrespectful, annoying, and energy-sapping, but not malicious. Together, though, that's 70% that's wearing me down. 

I'm shaking even writing about these incidents. The first day back from Christmas break, I had a major anxiety attack which resulted in two sick days, a trip to the ER, and increased dose of anti-anxiety medication. With STAAR tests looming, more teachers are starting to become physically ill. Our SS teacher has been forced to go on anti-depressants and blood pressure medication since he started last year. One of our veteran teachers (something like 16 years in the field) has been out ""ill"" for three weeks and, I suspect, does not plan to return. They have given her classes and homeroom to another teacher. 

I am literally to the point of emotional and mental withdrawal. Admin does nothing to protect us, and when I call for help (only when a student is posing a threat to me or his classmates, or some other major behavior that I don't have the authority to assign a consequence for), they often don't respond until I've texted twice or thrice. Then they ""peek in"" the window to validate the call before they'll step in. It's demeaning and leaves us open to all kinds of demoralization and abuse.

I don't know if I can make it for the last two months. I am at the end of my rope, relying on synthetic hormones to maintain control, and am watching the teachers around me make themselves sick. All while being asked to ""just give those students more love"" and ""restore relationships."" I had to buy a kid in my homeroom breakfast, at my supervisors ""suggestion"" because I called home after his repeated disrespect in class. He acts like an ass, I have to buy him Starbucks. And boy he jumped on it. He was so ready with that order. I just can't. 

This post is already basically a novel so I'll stick to providing more details upon request, but...veteran teachers, help??? What can I do? How does your school protect you from this kind of thing? Or do they? How do you protect yourself?? If you don't have advice, I could also use validation that this is not normal. :(

I am a month into my first student teaching placement. I got placed at an inner city secondary school, which is known for being very rough. I have been having a terrible increase in daily anxiety in this situation. I am having an incredibly difficult time interacting with the students, whom are very rough around these edges, and take any opportunity to disrespect me or mock me. I am not yet skilled at dealing with these situations. 

A weakness of my personality would be that I am quite agreeable and neurotic. I have a hard time standing up for myself. That being said, I am motivated, well versed in my subject areas and capable of making engaging lessons and presenting them decently. 

The main issue is dealing with behavior management, and I suppose classroom management in general. I am not a very authoritarian person. 

I know I am young and I am new so I am trying to cut myself some slack, but it feels difficult to deal with these weakness's, and I wonder if I am cut out for this type of job. It doesn't help that this school doesn't believe in punishment or discipline, so when a student says ""fuck you"" I feel like I can't really make them face any consequences for their behavior.

Can anybody help me out? advice?

""Your brighter future"" seems an insufficient myth for many young people. It doesn't appeal to them. They don't buy it, don't believe it, don't care.

Now, I can't imagine a single ""why"" that would unite my diverse groups of learners. Perhaps the answer lies in guiding each learner to find their *own* ""why"" - their own reason for coming to school and learning (not just hanging out with friends or using the wifi).

I'm a computer programmer who does lots of web development, and it was a class in web development, so that seemed a good fit, but I have little teaching experience.  Mostly things have gone okay, and I've gotten help now and again from him and the department chair.

My biggest problem is that I overestimated the students' abilities by kind of a wide margin, and the semester project I assigned - a web page that I coded myself in about 3 hours to make sure it wouldn't be too hard - is way too hard.  The students are working in groups of 2 or 3, and there are 12 groups.  So far, only one has actually gotten the project to work.  The others have gotten bogged down in either (1) tons of simple mistakes that just never occurred to me (forgetting to close quotes, for example, and mismatched parentheses), or (2) given that parts A and B work, getting them to work together.  These students have all had some programming classes, I guess they don't have much programming maturity yet.

The semester has ended, they've had three weeks to work on the project, and I'm worried that I'm looking at a train wreck.  The students are going leave demoralized and feeling like they didn't learn much, and they'll finish the semester with a failure instead of a success.  I can grade gently on a curve, so nobody flunks, but I really wanted them to walk out with something impressive they could show at a job interview, and instead they're going to walk out with a bunch of buggy code that does almost nothing.

I'm a little embarrassed to ask my friend or another professor for help; he kind of gave me a big buildup on my technical skills, and I feel sort of like I've let him down on the teaching part since he recommended me.

If I could go back in time one month I'd give a completely different project, but I can't.  The final exam is next week, and I was planning to use the exam period to do in-class presentations so people could show off what they've done, but now I'm pretty sure nobody's going to want to get up in front of the class and say ""This is the mess I made which doesn't do anything.""

My best idea right now is (1) spend the exam period debugging their websites, and (2) give them until the end of finals week to finish the project now that they've got more help.  But I'm not sure that another 3 days will help after 3 weeks of no progress, and they've got other exams to study for in other classes.

I'd welcome suggestions or advice from any experienced teachers about how they'd handle a situation like this.  OR, just as valuable, if you were in a situation like this as a new teacher and what you suggest I do NOT do.

Normally, I can think back and figure out where I dropped the ball when this happens. However, I have a situation with a couple of classes right now and I honestly don't know whether the fault is mine or theirs.  

First, I teach biology to college freshmen and sophomores. They're mostly not science majors, and I know that so I don't expect them to study as hard or to know as much as science majors would. I expect them to work hard and learn the information, but I'm not at all unreasonable and most people usually pass with an A or a B unless they just don't turn in their work or take advantage of any the many opportunities they have to pull up their grades. Anyway, when we first started going over Punnett squares, I told them there would be a big essay question about this information in the future so they should be absolutely sure they understood them and could answer questions about them. They've had a homework assignment on Punnett Squares and an extra credit assignment involving Pedigrees (which are related but make you work a little harder to figure things out). I also told them more or less exactly what they needed to learn to do well on the question (review the terminology for the different types of alleles, review dihybrid crosses and when to use them, etc..) a week before the test and again a few days before the test. And, finally, I told them to be sure to practice doing Punnett squares sometime BEFORE midnight on the day of the test so they'd know if there was a problem before it was too late to do anything about it.

So far, they've almost universally bombed this question. What's more, some of their mistakes make it pretty clear that a not insignificant number of them don't even understand the most basic fundamentals of how it works. I keep trying to figure out how this happened or if (or how) I let them down, but I honestly cannot think of anything else I could have done. This has always been a challenging question and other classes have struggled with it in the past, but not this badly. Furthermore, I made sure to give them ample warning this time because I know it's hard AND I told them exactly what they'd need to know to answer it well. 

So my question is, this. Is this my fault (it's okay if the answer is ""yes"". I'm honestly more interested in being an effective teacher than in vindication)? If it is my fault, does anyone have any suggestions for how I can approach this differently in the future. If it's not my fault, how do I get the little horsies to drink once I've led them to the trough of water labeled ""What you need to know to answer that question""? I realize, that you probably can't answer any of these questions exceptionally well without knowing more about the situation, but I welcome any advice you can give.

As the title states I'm a first year teacher at a small charter school. Last year I struggled to land a job at a public school but had a friend that knew someone on the board of the school I now currently work at. The students and staff are great. I don't want to leave. However, I was hired on to teach all of their physical science content. Being so new I didn't know what to expect and assumed since they hired me it would be doable. 

Fast forward close to a year and I'm seeing a therapist for the first time in a decade, I'm taking anti-anxiety medication and I've lost close to 10 pounds. I'm not looking for sympathy, rather I want to give you a vivid picture of the hell that has been my first year. 

My intentions were to stay on next year because I was told that there were plans to hire another science teacher which would reduced my preps to 4, which still isn't great but better. 

Last week I looked at the master schedule and saw that there isn't another science teacher and I've been given 5 preps again including an AP class that I'm not ready to teach. My principal came to talk to me that she tried to get another science teacher but ""it wasn't in the budget"" and that ""she understood if I wanted to leave."" 

I'm currently trying to find a job but I'm worried that I won't find one for the next school year. Should I stay? Should I sub? Would it look bad to have a gap year where I went back to substitute teaching? 

I need some help. I'm currently on break (year around) and struggling to find an answer. 

Let me also say that I still love teaching, just not so many damn classes. 

Thanks in advance. I tried to keep this stream of thoughts as organized as possible but if something doesn't make sense let me know. 

Edit: The CEO caught wind that I was looking for a new position and forced me to resign. She was gracious enough to ""make the decision a little easier"" for me.

I am a teaching assistant at a high school and I manage &amp; organize a 9th grade class. Lately, I have been having girls (9th grade) come to me to complain about a student in their class that is being creepy and whos very touchy. 

Some of the things he does includes:
-touching their back/arms/legs
-trying to rub their shoulders
-giving them unsolicited hugs and arms around their shoulder
-staring at their chest and talking about it to other kids in class
-""brushing"" up against them from behind 
-off remarks about their body, lips, etc

The girls came to me at different times, and told me they didn't want to tell the teacher because its ""awkward"" and he's a male (im a female teaching assistant). All of this student's touching and actions in general are completely unsolicited and unwanted, and they want him to stop but they said when they tell him to stop, he stops for only a couple days and then starts again. 

I have no idea what to do or who to tell. Parent/teacher interviews are coming up and his father came by last term, so I only assume he'll come back again. Should I tell the teacher, or guidance counsellor, or parent? No idea. Thanks in advance for the answers.

This is my first post to the community and I am a middle grades education student who  is one final class and my student teaching away from getting my Master's Certification in Middle Grades ELA. 

My question is this for the community, I have a project to begin that we were put into groups for (the project is on Integrated Unit planning) where we have to have a central theme and the it across a whole team of subjects  (ELA,  Maths, Science, History) my confusion is this: my group mates have come up with the idea of a theme of ""Community Engagement"" and found ways to the all their subjects to this theme while telling me after (I missed the planning meeting because of a family emergency) that they skipped doing suggestions for ELA because it is the easiet to do.

My question to the group before my anxiety eats me alive is thus: what the hell do I do to create a 10 lesson unit plan (which was the assignment instruction) tied to this theme?? I have no idea what to do and I am completely burned out from anxiety.

I’m in a 10th grade math class and for the most part they are well-behaved, and they are all reasonably strong in math, but there’s a group of chatty jock-type guys that sit together in the back. They’re usually respectful to me and my cooperating teacher and know math pretty well, but they can get distracted easily.

Today (Friday) in our school was the Day of Silence, a protest for the LGBTQ2+ community and its supporters. The students knew this. When I was helping a student during class with a homework question, I was standing near these chatty jocks and I believe I heard two of them say that today was “Queer Day”.

In hindsight, I absolutely should have said something to them as soon as it happened. But since I wasn’t sure if I’d heard anything, no students seemed to react to it, and my co-op teacher was out of the room doing some photocopying, I figured I had misheard them.

Now I realize my mistake in potentially letting something harmful go unmentioned in my classroom. Should I bring it up on Monday? I worry that there are students in my class who heard me ignore a harmful comment and no longer trust me.

 No where in my resume do I reference a master's degree. For education it says, **university, major, date of graduation.**

I drove up from NC to NYC for this interview and was a little miffed that I was basically told I had no chance of being hired by any school because of this. I had previously looked at inter-state reciprocity and no where is a master's degree part of the requirements. For reference, the webpage I visited was this [one] (http://www.highered.nysed.gov/tcert/certificate/teachrecotherprogram.html#ClassroomProgram). 

They suggested I look into the NY teaching fellows program which I have heard of before. My understanding is that it is for lateral entry candidates, however, I graduated with a teacher education degree so I was confused as to why they were suggesting this.

Anyways, is it true that a master's is required? If it is, do you have any documentation since I cannot find any online. The interviewer, an AP at the school mentioned that this has been a thing 8-9 years in NY. 

I guess this was a little bit of a vent since it's annoying that I spent so much money coming up here when an email saying I wasn't qualified would have been sufficient.

As part of an incentive/reward program I have, I give out toy money and the students can use it as a classroom currency (to buy toys, games, etc.). Part of the system I have, is that the students change small bills for larger denominations, this enables me to not have runaway inflation. There was a time that I did not do that, and I gave out five dollar bills until I corralled the singles. This tidbit is useful in understanding the students' thought process...

A few days ago, I realized I was running out of singles and, using superb observational skills, I noticed two students with a gigantic stack of singles. They knew the drill, and they were not following through with it. Fast forward to today, and I am critically low in singles. Another student jumps on the bandwagon - after me asking him for his singles for which I can give him larger bills, he answers, ""No, I only want singles."" I smiled and moved on.

Alas, I ran out of singles. However, their plan did not quite work...

I circulated among the class, handing out five dollar bills, as I had no more singles - and skipped over those three students. Not once, not twice, but FIVE times. Suffice it to say, they were not enthused. A common refrain was, ""Why can't we get fives?? We're doing our work!!"" I called for attention in the class and made an announcement, ""There are some students that are upset that they are not getting any money. I feel terrible, I don't have any more singles, and they ONLY WANT SINGLES!"" The class burst out laughing.

If it helps, we are looking at traveling from the United States to China, Peru, Equador or Namibia for summer 2019!

- mission statement


- passport information/timeline


- safety requirements: students will not be able to drink, purchase alcohol/tobacco, drive, hitchhike or rent vehicles (do we need an Uber guideline?), even if they are of age in that country. No smoking, vaping, illegal drugs, etc. This will be treated as a school event. 


- Misc policy ideas: social media policy? Dress code? No piercings or tattoos policy? Use of firearms? 


- electronics policy (school is not liable for these items and recommends they be insured). Chaperones may remove phones if used inappropriately. 


- behavioral incidents before the trip (not taking students with significant ""records"", will have expectations with a set number) will be reviewed on an individual basis 


- outline all school rules to be followed


- following laws...US and the country we are visiting


- travel back policy...may not leave our group/chaperones for another trip, also consequences if a student has to be sent back


- consequences for behavior that does not warrant sending them back?


- students and their families are responsible for any damages caused by the student. 


- list of expected expenses (exchange rate information), any relevant fundraising timelines and guidelines

My district for example starts out at 13/hr, whereas the district a town over is 17/hr starting pay. As a special education teacher, I am well aware that the amount of work, and paperwork, in addition to needing to be “highly qualified” and completing more schoolwork and student teaching hours required are greater than a gen ed degree.

Only problem is i haven't really taken philosophy in a long time and i have no resources as it's not taught anywhere in my district.

Does anyone have any suggestions, ideas, and/or resources i could use to cram some philosophy in these last few weeks?

I think I'm making the right decision. This makes me sad for myself but sadder for teaching in general.","My school is changing my job back to classroom teacher, and I have known for awhile that I don't want to do this. I've been very candid about it. It's mostly for personal reasons, but I've also learned about myself that my personality type is far better suited to working with classes in small doses. I know that being a teacher isn't a punishment, and I don't think my boss sees it that way - but when I told her I didn't think it was a good fit and, explained my reasons (which I kept focused on the professional), she just shrugged and said ""sorry."" As in ""I guess you're going to quit but oh well."" There wasn't even a conversation. 

I don't think I am invincible, and part of working for any company is being flexible. But I feel like I (and other teachers) deserve the courtesy of having some input on the future of my career. This isn't an adjustment in what I do - it's a completely different job. My district wants to fix their turnover problem. They want to be a place where people can build careers. Some people are given opportunities beyond ""do this because I said so"", but I've given up trying to figure out how and why. (Literally just last week an inexperienced, unlicensed teacher was left in charge of our building for the day when the principals were out because he's ""good with discipline."" We have people in our building with administrators' licenses!) 

My initial plan was to try to find a similar position at another school in our district, but ... I don't think I'm going to. I am coming to the sad realization that this is not a place where teachers are valued. Even if I found a spot elsewhere, I could be in the same position next year.

I know I've had a positive impact on my school and students this year. I've been incredibly reliable and dependable (in a district where people quit mid-year *constantly*) and was even recognized by the district. I wasn't sure what I'd be doing next year, but I figured there would be *something* I could do for this district. I'm hurt and I feel silly for thinking it would be different. 

I'm sad for teaching because this seems to reflect how professionalism and passion no longer seem to be rewarded. Teachers used to stay at the same schools for their entire careers. That seems unheard of now.

I have come a long way since then and thought I'd share my journey for posterity. 

So I started off this year more excited than I have ever been to start my career. Being 24, I was pretty excited that someone actually heard me and decided to give me a shot. Not too far into the school year, however, I started having serious doubts about what I wanted out of my life. I have having a horrible time. Students were ass holes, I was making mistakes, administrators were grilling me for them and it just seemed like I was two steps behind every day. I nearly quit at the semester. But I decided that I would finish what I started and at the very least finish my first year. I am so thankful for that decision, because I love my job and love my life more than I ever have before. 


For those reading and feel what I felt, I don't have much advice to give because I am a fucking noob. But that in itself is advice. Accept that you are a fucking noob. Just like you finish high school being king of the campus and start college as a peasant, you finish college as an ""enlightened"" individual and start life as a god damned noob. When I accepted this, the job became easier to deal with. It was easier to deal with my failures. It's not supposed to be easy, you won't always have a good time, and your conviction will be tested every day. If you can find some comfort in that and put in the effort to fix one mistake at a time you will hopefully grow exponentially just like you did your 9th grade and college freshman years. Or you'll say fuck this and quit like I almost did. Either way, it's gonna be alright.

For those reading because they read my original post and want an update, I finished my ACP (still do not recommend it to anyone) and just kept my head down and fixed each mistake one by one until I eventually got a good grasp for the kind of teacher I want to be and what I need to do to make that happen, and most importantly decided that I wanted to make it happen. The biggest influence on my change of philosophy was when I opened up to my students and began to build relationships with them. I discovered how profound it can be to make an impact of any kind on a student's life. I learned that as educators we choose to either focus on the bad experiences or the good ones, and to me it is my natural inclination to focus on the good. I forget my negative encounters quicker but hold on to the good ones for longer.   


I hope I can grow more and more every year and become the best teacher I'm capable of being but I also recognize that this will take a life time, and I am willing to try it. I love my job, I love my life, and I signed up for season 2 of Mr. M's Spanish class.

Coding concepts not only instill logical and linear thinking among kids, but also develop their reasoning abilities. 
This is how coding concepts can help kids to learn things about real-life situations. 
1. Functions: Functions teaches students about the cause and effect relationship of things in the word. 
2. Loops: Coding loops embody all the happenings around us that occur repeatedly.
3. Conditional codes: There are so many conditions we apply in daily like to define the course of our actions and decisions.

This will be my first year as a teacher.

School A is a school I student taught at. I’ll be teaching algebra 1 in a class that shares time and space with an excellent veteran teacher teaching physics. The school has a very positive atmosphere. It’s a small school in a large campus. The principal is nice but laissez faire, and never remembers my name. As well I would be teaching an Algebra tutorial class, so basically only 1 real prep. As well the school does linked learning (project based learning), and uses the block system. The student demographic is majority latinx. As well, I live down the street currently. The student math skills coming in are very low, and I’ll also have a contingent of ELD students. All the teachers there have been really lovely to me, and the kids have a lot of potential.

School B is a large comprehensive school with an excellent reputation. They’re pretty traditional. They don’t have a 1-1 student to laptop/computer/iPad ratio. They don’t utilize linked project based learning, but they’re not opposed to a teacher implementing aspects of that. I’d be teaching Financial Algebra 2. The principal is very well liked among the staff, and seems very responsive. The department chair is really young, but seems like he has great intentions. The student population is very diverse with a ~80% minority population. It’s a 45 minute bus bike or drive from my house, but close to my daughter’s nanny, and closer to my grad school. The school routinely has math test scores above state average, and is listed silver on US News. A real achievement for a title 1 school. 

I should consider myself lucky to even have this choice. Both schools are superb, but I’m not sure how to decide between them. They’re both in the same district too. Any advice would be super helpful! Thanks!

EDIT
I am being assigned a specific subject at one school.

Other things to consider.

School A can’t make me a formal offer till my mentor teacher, who’ll I’ll be replacing, finds another job. Even though she’s moving to the other end of the district. I believe it’s the biggest school district in at least my state.

I don’t speak fluent Spanish, but 60% of School A’s parents only speak Spanish. 

School A will be left in the lurch. They haven’t been actively searching for a new teacher since they have to wait for the mentor teacher to find a new job.

School B is in a very expensive area, so I’ll never be able to live in the neighborhood. However, most the kids don’t either...

I resigned from my 9th/11th grade English teaching position at a small, rural, Oklahoma high school. I was miserable for a number of reasons:  I don’t like teaching Juniors, because I have trouble establishing authority with that age; my room had VERY poor,  almost non-existent air-conditioning and I burnt up all year in the heat; we had limited technology and somehow i had to teach research papers with one lab in the whole school; the students didn’t really care about academics as most of them are already securing jobs on the pipeline or oil rig; and— most of all— I have CRIPPLING anxiety and I do not handle confrontation or conflict well. I found myself always in the middle of a confrontation with a student who was misbehaving for whatever reason. I felt SUCH relief upon resigning I cannot tell you. I essentially talked myself down from a panic attack every morning before school.

Fast forward:  the hiring manager from my hometown district called me wanting me to interview for an English job there. It is a bigger school with a more solid focus on academics, more technology, and probably air conditioned rooms. They are literally desperate to fill several open positions that no one is applying for because, well...Oklahoma. I told her I did not want higher grades and she said it would probably be 9th/10th. What’s the harm in interviewing? Right? I rationalized interviewing as “Maybe things will be different in a different district.” 

I got to the interview and made it as clear as I could (I am not assertive) that I wanted only lower grades. The superintendent then said it would probably be 11th grade. NOOOOOO. The interview was all-around weird as they were somewhat confused about why I left my other district. They all know me and know what a hard worker I am, and they are so desperate to hire anyone, I think i will be offered the job. But I don’t know if I should take it. Should I just give it a try? Should I tell them “Not unless it’s 9th/10th”? My anxiety is still with me and that probably won’t be any different this time around, but my husband is so much less stressed when I work, and I want to at least try it to take the burden off him.  HELP.


Also—- I will have my Master’s in Guidance Counseling next December. I want to work with students, but the classroom environment overwhelms me.

Now, today they had someone else in with me to see if they wanted the job. Apparently my principal has more people lined up. I only was told today to come in for tomorrow.

I'm looking for guidance for my 1st-year teacher fiancée (1st grade).,"My fiancée, like all of you, is extremely passionate about teaching. She's known she wanted to do this since before she reached middle school. Years of schooling, scholarships, experience at various schools/programs later and she's had the roughest year of her life in CPS (typical? ha...). She has a slight meltdown at least 3-4 times a week, crying on the drive home, calling me crying from school, but mostly breaking down at home. If I were to tell that to folks not familiar with the work that actually goes into teaching, they'd think my fiancée is weak or something. No, she's just put an incredible amount of time/money/care into her students and they (both students and parents) just spit into her face day after day. Let's go over some fun examples:

- students constantly calling her a cunt/bitch/etc. (or calling her fat, which she isn't... and on a side note, this insult comes from the kid who is unfortunately very poorly fed at home so she is extremely obese)
- students constantly tell her that their dad/mom are going to beat the shit out of her
- A parent, who was previously removed from the building, sneaking back into the building through a side entrance with volunteer traffic folks... so that she can come and berate my fiancée while she was trying to teach a class

There are many more, of course. By and large, these kids come from difficult homes. I don't blame them for what they do (which is easier for me, since I don't have to deal with them like she does). My largest frustration is the complete and utter abandonment of my fiancée on the part of the administration of CPS. I'm not very familiar with school systems, but my fiancée doesn't get any support from her principal (he gets his own section), assistance principal, or any reps from the union. She has to teach a class size above what her contract dictates, about 30-31 on average for the year, with a large portion of the class having IEP's and don't receive any outside help. The best help she gets is from the organization that she had her scholarship with. She has a mentor through them that's been helpful to a degree.

Her principal... where do I start? On the surface: a self-important scum bag that throws himself birthday parties (he spent a few hours in photoshop putting together a flyer for his birthday party - looks like something you'd see for an NYE party at a club except it has his face in front and center). A little deeper, uses go-knows-what funding to throw random parties with party buses and invites his old frat buddies to join with his staff of mostly younger females. A little deeper, imagine my fiancée stuck in a party bus having to sit on or be sat on by the friends of her principal. This is the principal that goes out and parties with his teachers, grinding out in the bars.

Outside of that ridiculous shit, this is an ""up and coming"" principal that ""turned around"" this south side school, by turning it into a ""+1"" school by focusing on the data. I'm sure everyone here loves that word, ""data."" Because of how he has done in the school, he's supposedly being promoted up the chain. Due to this, he is out of the school most days and unavailable to his staff, only answering the emails he finds important and often many days after receiving them. He's the boss that you don't hear from for long periods of time, but hear from them whenever they see some metric being slightly off (gotta have better data!).

In an effort to advance his career, I see my fiancée's principal helping to continue a cycle in his school that serves only to diminish the opportunity that his students will have in their early educations. In an effort to have better data, students are seemingly shoved through grade by grade. My fiancée isn't budging on her student data, but it seems the atmosphere in the school leans heavy in that direction. My fiancée's class came into 1st grade performing at a level that should be seen in maybe early kindergarten. They won't be finishing at a pre-2nd grade level, but fairly close to that. She is proud about the improvement she has seen.

I apologize for ranting. I'm not even the one that has a hellish work life (that bleeds heavily into her personal life, as with all teachers). I've thought of posting on this sub many times, but have held back. She just called me a little bit ago over her lunch crying. I'm not sure if she can even finish out this year. And while all this is happening, she's trying her best to get another job. My job is up near north shore so she is looking for a school more on the northside (anywhere from Oak Park all the way up to Deerfield.

I hope I didn't say anything offensive. I'd appreciate any words of advice you may have and I'd love to be able to PM a fellow chicago-area teacher.

TL:DR - My fiancée is having the worst year of her life by a large margin and I'm not sure how much more time she has as a teacher because of it. And if she doesn't teach, she will be lost as that's all she's ever wanted to do.",false,8jeupd,,0,,false,1529722284,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/8jeupd/venting_any_chicago_public_school_teachers_in/,t3_8jeupd,,,,

I just had a thought to submit a post about some of the experiences I've had in education. For a couple of years now, I've been wanting to start an advocacy program, or at least help, struggling teachers who cannot get their license. I recently just got mine, but it took me 3 WHOLE YEARS to get it. I'm still struggling, but hopefully not for long, and have for years now because I didn't have my license. I was treated not fairly, looked down on, and basically cut down to size without it. I worked as a toddler teacher, preschool assistant, substitute, and even a teacher ( for a brief time- I'll explain more at the end) So as you can imagine, I have done everything in my power to teach without having the license. I am from Indiana, and it took me around 1000 ( including practice exams, cost for exams) to actually get my license. That is not easy money for me to get a hold of, but of course, it was over a course of about 3 years I spent it in order to get my license. The money, however, is only a small reason why I want to advocate. The bigger reason, is that I spent years ( 5 years) in school in order to get my degree and worked really hard for it. So, after graduating, my hopes were high until it was all completely shut down when I failed my exam twice. I wanted to give up. The main reason I want to advocate is because of how I was treated without it. I saw the disappointing looks from my coworkers or prospective employees when I told them I wasn't certified.  I could feel the dismay and disappointment; it only made me feel worse about myself. Sure, I would meet the occasion, hopeful and happy person who would try to build me up, and it was encouraging to have some very much needed support. However, it was the people I worked with, who either treated me like nothing and my employer who I knew deep down that they felt like I didn't measure up. In short, I didn't experience much shame as a toddler teacher, in fact, they were happy I was there. But I did feel overly qualified, and people would look at me like ""why the hell are you here, and not teaching?!"" So, I felt like I could not win for losing. It wasn't until I left child care, and became a substitute and assistant, did I realize how much that little piece of paper could do to someone. As a substitute I took on some long-term roles, and one that stands out to me is a middle school math role I agreed to take on. During that time, the teacher there who was supposed to actually be teaching, and I work as an assistant, took advantage of me. On the second day, she basically told me to grade papers and gave me her school password and told me not to tell anyone. Keep in mind I was only making around 80 dollars a day, which isn't much considering all I was doing. By day three I was teaching the class. I did this for almost 2 months, and she even had me make phone calls to parents. The parents thought I was the teacher!!! I felt like I was the dude from Catch Me If You Can! Then it just all got worse from there. I went on to be an assistant to a preschool teacher, and it was awful. It was an extremely easy job however, but they let me do absolutely nothing! The first thing they told me when I got hired was that they didn’t want my credentials ( since I had a degree) to get in the way or to step on their toes. So the entire time I felt useless and looked at as if I wasn’t good enough. My final experience that really took the cake was when I got hired at a charter school. Just a bit of background, they were THE ONLY school in the entire metro area I live in that were hiring teachers without a license. They basically would have taken anyone who was living and breathing and had a degree. Long story short, I was treated with the most disrespect I’ve ever experienced in my entire life. That includes working fast food. I was yelled at by parents and ganged up on by other employees who worked at this god-awful place. The district was very low-income families, and in combination of all of the work load, extra hours, and basically no freedom in the classroom, I felt defeated. All the while I kept thinking to myself, if only I had my license, then I wouldn’t be in this situation. The school had the most ridiculous routines and procedures in place, that basically made the entire experience feel like a prison for the students and myself included. I had no freedom in lesson planning, only one subject while we worked on it as a team for each subject. The entire team ganged up on me because I didn’t submit to them a few worksheets. Besides having a legitimate excuse of the copier not working, which they didn’t seem to care the least bit about, having one more worksheet put on these poor students was the least of my worries since it felt like a worksheet factory to begin with. I never really became “buddy buddy” with the girls on my team, and I think they felt threatened by me. I do not know, and I really don’t care, because working there was by far the worse working environment I’ve ever been in.  I ran for the hills the first chance I could. The entire time I worked there I kept telling myself I wasn’t good enough. That maybe I was there because I wasn’t a good teacher. After all, I didn’t’ have my license and that thought just played over and over again in my head like a broken record. I even told myself that this is what I deserved, because I am not certified. But in reality, no one deserved that treatment, and if I had it my way, I’d shut that school down as fast as you can say Jack Robinson. Any who, that is my story, and I know I am not the only one who has went through turmoil and grief just trying to do what they love, and that is to teach. I want to help others who are in the same situation, and I’m not sure where to start. Should I start with the company who administrates the test? They, after all, only have a 30% passing rate which in typical academia standards is pretty low. Perhaps a newspaper article, just to get the word out? I am new to advocacy, but it is something I want to pursue. If I had a group of supporters and people going through the same thing I was going though, I know it would have made my journey at least a little more bearable. I didn’t find the support I needed until just the past 6 months. My boyfriend and his family encouraged me and helped me financially to come up with the money to even take the exams. My own family helped but could not give me the hundreds of dollars I needed for the exams and study materials included. It would be nice to come up with some kind of program so teachers who are struggling could have a grant or voucher also, because I know my story is not the only one. I never usually post anything this lengthy so if you have any ideas or suggestions on where I should even start, it would be appreciated. ��

I didn’t even bother grading because it was definitely a failed test, and she’s in resource; therefore I figured a rewrite with the resource teacher was in order. It’s how we operate at our school. And I might add that she’s in resource for emotional reasons impeding academic ability. So, she gets stressed and emotional when she doesn’t understand. She rarely asks questions in class but then, come the day of a test, makes excuses of not understanding anything, or blames me for not giving them enough time to study or for never answering any of her questions (she claims she does raise her hand but I never get to her. Strange...)

Anyway, today the resource teacher informs me that the girl told her she didn’t “have to” write the test; that her father said she didn’t have to. Her father... a fellow teacher, to boot! 

I’m a little shocked about this, and also the fact that the father didn’t come talk to me himself. Of course there’s the chance Polly is lying but it would be a bit unusual for her to do so - she also knows we can easily go ask her dad for confirmation of this. 

The resource teacher said she could look into it with the father. She also asked me what the girl’s average was, apparently to gauge how essential this test is to her final grade. I checked and she’s in the 70s. 

Is this ridiculous? Am I making a mountain out of a molehill? I don’t want to jump to conclusions either without knowing the full story.

So I just noticed a post [(link here)] (https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8cdtdq/anybody_here_read_voraciously_as_a_kid_fell_off/) in which so many people described being burned out of reading in school, even if they were big readers as kids.  I experienced the same thing; I was a voracious reader up until my junior/senior year of high school, and then I couldn't pick up a book for pleasure for the next 10 years.  Even books that I would have otherwise enjoyed had to be analyzed and torn apart to the point where there was no joy in reading whatsoever.  As a reading teacher, it's bumming me out that so many people experience reading burnout.


Is this a result of having so much required reading in school?  I definitely see it on the Elementary level with Accelerated Reader, in which students have to read a metric ton of books each year.  AR is a huge focus in my school, and lots of kids start the year off strong, but by spring it's hard to get even the good readers to pick up a book.  Truthfully, even I can't read as much as they do without tiring myself out.


I'm wondering if there's some kind of middle ground here; a way to get kids to practice reading, read for pleasure, and not get burned out like I and so many others did.

1523206296,teaching,Motorvision,self.teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/8ar6s6/thoughts_and_observations_on_american_education/,13,32,32,0,Thoughts and Observations on American Education,"I am a (male) teacher who works as an elementary teacher. I have been in education since 2012. These are just some thoughts and reflections I wanted to share in my time in public education. Feel free to add your own or discuss my points (or both, preferably). A couple of things I'd like to point out: 1) these are based on my experiences teaching in the Midwest, and might be different from someone else's. My experiences come from two small town districts and one district in a mid-sized city. None of the districts come anywhere near ""progressive""; 2) I'm not claiming these are radical or original thoughts. I just wanted to share what I've observed. These are in no order:

- We are creating a culture of compliance in our schools, not just for the students, but for teachers as well. It seems like any sort of dissenting opinion is quickly taken care of, and we're focused more on ""yes"" instead of anything constructive

- Professional development is a joke. Nearly every PD I've gone to has been nothing more than someone speaking with a PowerPoint presentation. Even if they had good ideas/concepts, there was no practical way to try them out. You just show up, listen to someone talk, and leave. This needs to change

- A lot of teachers I meet don't actually seem to enjoy learning. They like ""teaching"", but with a few exceptions, most I've met don't go out of their way to learn new things unless they're forced to through work or they read some watered down article online. In my view, a classroom and its students are a reflection of the teacher, and if that teacher doesn't continue to learn and educate themselves, how can they teach?

- Related to the above two points, teachers need to be encouraged to find/read/discover new ideas and concepts on their own, not just at PD or because they saw something on Pinterest or their teacher friend gave them an idea

- Education needs to slow down, stop chasing whatever silly fad is currently popular, and remember the fundamentals of teaching. Dress it up all you want, claim that it's research-based and has x benefits, but at the end of the day, if a kid still can't read, maybe you should take a step back and tone it down

- Teaching, especially at the elementary level, is too homogeneous; too many of the same kind of person occupy our schools. These people are generally white, female, and middle class. There's nothing wrong with being any of these things, but the issue is that if you are not, it becomes difficult for you to fit in. The other issue I find is that many of these people use the same methods, have the same interests, etc. To put it in more bluntly, a lot of these people are ""basic"". This isn't to say they're bad teachers or don't mean well, but our schools would do well to find more diverse teachers, including teachers who come from different fields (for example, my original field was communication, not education) to encourage different ideas flowing in and different approaches. As it is, there's a dangerous amount of groupthink that I find among teachers/administration

- We've created this bizarre obsession with data, to the point where I've seen some teachers seemingly prioritize that over actually teaching. Data is important, yes, but if we keep obsessing over it we're going to wreck ourselves

- These are pet peeves of mine: teachers need to stop saying they're ""superheroes"", and teachers need to stop playing victim. On the former: it's nothing more than inflated ego and mediocre teachers placing themselves on a pedestal, claiming to be heroes while kids are still barely at grade level. On the latter: yes, conditions are poor in a lot of schools, a lot of admin are clueless, parents can suck, etc, but you still chose this profession with that in mind, and you're keeping yourself in it. Find a new school, or a new career, if it's bothering you that much

- This applies to elementary specifically, but I don't like how I've seen teachers infantilize students (I'm talking second grade and up). Yes, they're kids, but I've seen too many teachers speak condescendingly to kids, give them easy work, refuse to be strict because they're fearful of ""being mean"", and so on. They're children, yes, but keeping this fixed mindset that they're ""only kids"" is harming more than helping

- Stop lowering standards. This harms our students more than it helps

- Administration needs to remember that we (teachers) are in the business of teaching our students, helping them learn and grow, and keeping them (and their families) happy. We are not here to kiss admin's ass and make THEM happy

- More teachers need to take risks and think outside the box. But going back to the ""culture of compliance"" and our awful PD, teachers are either scared to do this, don't know how, or both. This needs to change

- Teaching, in a lot of ways, epitomizes the worst of American work habits/culture. Teachers have this idea that the more hours they work (and then brag to you about), the better they are, and they look down on anyone who somehow works less than them. Get on any social media site, it won't take you long to see some teacher complaining about the number of hours they work a week. Yes, there are a lot of expectations in public schools, but a good chunk of this is down to poor management and organization on their part too

- I've met some great people who are teachers, but on the other hand, the pettiest, most passive-aggressive people I've ever met have all been teachers too. PA/pettiness seems rampant in the world of education, in both men and women. Teaching attracts a certain kind of person, but why do a lot of them come off as immature and PA? This is ironic given that we need to be teaching our students how to be mindful and respectful

- Most teachers, especially young/new ones, need to forget about the romance and their ""passion"" for teaching and get practical. I feel too many people get into this job thinking they could be the next feel-good Hallmark film, and then drop into mediocrity (or quit) when they find out the real world is nothing like that

- Freedom and inquiry are the ideals and goals for any classroom, but the problem is that most students lack the required discipline and work ethic to make those ideals a reality. I've seen a lot of teachers either half-ass it, or skip over it altogether because ""it's beyond them, they're not capable."" Discipline is as important to education as anything else, but this is where I see most teachers fall very short

Again, keep in mind that these are based solely on my experiences. Please don't take anything personally.

She's wrapping up her second year teaching history/social studies at a highschool in the suburb of a major city. Some days she comes home and she's completely mentally exhausted. Because of her school's proximity to the city, she has a lot of kids with behavioral issues and these kids sometimes make her life and day totally miserable. Once every month or so she'll come home and just start trying to look for different jobs because it's just that bad. 

Her goal is to make it through one more school year so she becomes tenured at which point she'd like to try to get a job closer to where we live (which is much further from the city and therefore the kids are better behaved). She's also worried that when she goes to make this move she won't be able to find a job closer to home. The county she's in now requires her to commit to her contract sometime around now, but any school she'd want to work at wouldn't be able to offer her a job until the summer months. So she'd have to turn down the contract now and then sit in limbo for a few months hoping she gets a job. I'm used to being able to line up a new job before quitting my current one, but it seems like teachers aren't afforded that luxury. She could always commit to the contract and still find a new job, but it sounds like that would put a black mark on her file and may prevent her from getting a job in the county she's currently in should she choose to ever go back in the future.

She often comes to me for advice and to ask ""what do you think I should do?"" I can offer words of comfort, but whenever she asks this I have nothing to offer other than to tell her to do what makes her happy. So the question is, how do you comfort teachers who are struggling to cope with their days? And has anyone ever left the teaching profession entirely? What did you do? She's currently one year away from completing a masters in integrating technology into the classroom (not sure of exact degree name but that's the general premise), which might help her with future job prospects. 

And just to add, she doesn't always hate her job and for the most part she has a lot of students she loves, but there's always 4-6 bad apples that ruin it for her.

Anybody else dealing with a similar internal struggle? ",false,8ma5n4,,0,,false,1529773812,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/8ma5n4/im_considering_leaving_teaching_because_it_feels/,t3_8ma5n4,,,,

I started this week and I found out that I'm not really a specialist, I actually teach 4th and 5th grade science, 4th grade math, and 4th grade reading. I also stepped in during our first week of sba testing. This school is also known for being tough. 

These kids all knew me, loved me, and respected me, but they've turned into monsters. As a result I've been taking privileges away from whole classes, raising my voice, and issuing detentions left and right. All the teachers say I have no choice. I'm just so frustrated and I don't know what to do. Regardless of what I teach or how I teach it, they are disrespectful and rude and I feel like I've lost all control. I went from loving teaching to hating it in a week. I'm not under contract, and I would totally quit if I didn't have a contract for next year. 

The teachers keep saying they are so awful because I'm a sub, it's testing week, and it's really late in the year for these changes to be happening.  They have also said that if they knew I was considering the position they would have told me not to take it, but the principal didn't want me to talk about it with anyone.

I teach at an inner city high school with the usual problems. My kids have never been able to stop talking (made a previous post about it). They don’t care at all about detentions (most don’t even show up) and most barely care about ISS. 
The administration is nice enough, but usually too concerned with “real” problems like our many fights or are a bit pushovery and don’t like to actually punish the kids. 
I’ve been having trouble all year, but have basically given up asking for help/ trying since it’s highly discouraged to actually write students up/ the write ups get “lost”. 

I’m just upset because I got an email from my principal saying that he’s gotten reports of my class being too loud that it’s disturbing others. (Its true because they were literally screaming yesterday...I did write the two up for that but I don’t think anything will be done). “Others” would be the one teacher that’s near me though so that’s sad. The principal was saying it’s “unacceptable” and that if I need help to ask an administrator. I did! I’ve needed help all year! So many times I’d call the office and no one would be there. State tests just started so I know that’s why he’s so concerned about the noise.

I can’t send disruptive kids out because 90% of the time they won’t actually go to the office (I’m in a back nook of the school so no way to watch and make sure they go) and it’s practically a reward to get sent to the office anyway. 

We have 20 days left. I’m leaving and the principal knows this (he was completely understanding and fine with it lol). I just don’t know what to do anymore. I really don’t think I can make it.

I have an MA in English and taught college for several years. I'm currently in the middle of a family-raising gap, and SO thinks that when our children are in school, it would be nice for me to get a teaching certificate and start teaching high school English. While I agree that the (small amount of) extra money would be nice, I worry that he's underestimating the time commitment. He speaks of it as a 7:30 to 4:30 job with summers off, whereas my hunch is that it's 7:30 to 4:30 in the office, and then another two hours at night grading papers, more grading papers on the weekends, and multiple weeks of additional training required in the summer. He doesn't seem to ""get it"" when I say that a) it seems all teachers work a lot of unpaid overtime outside of school and b) English teachers work more overtime than most due to the grading load of papers. (I spent eight years teaching college. I know how much time grading papers takes.) 

To make sure I'm presenting the issue in a balanced way, I thought I'd get an accurate perspective from people on here. What are your experiences and observations regarding how much time a high school English teacher really puts into the job? I don't want either of us to be surprised if this ends being a 50-hour-a-week job for 32k a year. I want us to go into it with our eyes wide open if that's the case.

There will be new regular active shooter drills but there won't be any other added security features to the school. The video suggested we throw books at the shooter. I am disgusted and outraged at this response.
When I became a teacher, I did so with the intention of shaping young minds, not with the fear that I might have to take a bullet to protect their young lives. I love teaching, but it gets harder every year. Not to mention that our county is claiming a budget crisis and isn't going to be giving out scheduled raises anytime soon.

I am experienced but still ""green"" enough that I am open to change and allowing my strategies to be fluid.

When teaching science the big push is for ""inquiry based learning"" or various forms of that style where the student has to learn concepts through experimentation and along the way learns the value of investigating an curiosity. On paper I think this learning strategy is infallible but maybe it is better used for younger students when the concepts being taught are more abstract.

In my own classroom I do not use this strategy. Now that is not to say I don't allow my students to use their brains, investigate and explore the scientific world... I deliver instruction through more structured methods. I am supposed to be using an open ended model for my instruction but unless someone is observing me I generally teach in a more traditional manner. \(With that being said I believe I am a great teacher\- my lessons are entertaining, animated and interactive\)

My chemistry teacher counterpart at this school is a strong supporter of investigative learning and teaches this way in her classroom and I envy her commitment to the practice. I hear a lot of student feedback from other students on their teachers throughout the day and I routinely hear student's from her class say ""she doesn't teach"". Students who have been switched into my class from hers \(for whatever reason\) often remark that the difference between the two of us is that **I teach and she doesn't**. They often have poor grades due to not picking up on key information during their learning process. 

Knowing what I know about teaching philosophy and skills, what they are perceiving as ""not teaching"" is actually a learning strategy that they are supposed to be employing and benefiting from. I don't necessarily think it is fair to assess on ""hard facts"" if we utilize this teaching method. I have been trying to figure out how to internally justify these conflicting ideas and how to adjust my teaching accordingly.

Just for some background, I am a gay educator in California. I just received my multiple subject credential and am looking for jobs as a teacher (yay!). I have worked in education for a reasonably large public school district for 7 years. I currently managing a large, on campus after school daycare program for one of the elementary schools, and have built a very good rapport with the school administration, and administrations at other schools. 

Now, I am out to family, friends, and most coworkers, but am not out to my students or parents at work. Generally I don't talk about my personal life at work, but as all teachers know, kids are very inquisitive. Yesterday I had a student ask me, ""Do you have a girlfriend?"" To which I answered no. He then asked, ""Do you have a boyfriend?"" I also answered no (which is the truth). He proceeded to ask if I'd EVER had a boyfriend. I lied and told him no to protect my job security and relationships with parents/students.

My dilemma is that I don't think it's any of the kids business what my sexuality is, so I don't feel too bad for lying. At the same time, growing up, I NEVER had an adult male who was openly gay. It would have been very helpful to me, as a struggling gay mormon boy, to have a gay person to look up to. What if this student was fishing because he himself is questioning, or knows a friend who is? I would love to be a role model for LGBT kids, and have a safe place for students to go if they need support. I think it is important for young LGBT kids, and all kids really, to see LGBT adults in positions of authority, and that we are everywhere.

I am worried about the ramifications of being out. Obviously California is very liberal, but I live in a fairly conservative pocket. There are a lot of stereotypes surround gay men and children and I don't want my being out to students and parents affect my ability to become a teacher, and possibly a principal (One of my goals).

Please let me know what you all think, and if you are out to your students, or have an colleagues who are openly gay to students and parents, and how these situations are handled.",false,8i87k3,,0,,false,1529700753,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/8i87k3/lgbt_teachers_are_you_out_to_your_students/,t3_8i87k3,,,,

Details for the interested:

I teach high school English. Please forgive any errors in this post, as I am an emotional wreck and can neither type nor think clearly.

I put 120% of my heart and soul into my lessons and my class. I teach juniors and freshmen. 
As a whole, all the students care about is sneaking their phones. They do not listen. They do not care. Many are missing 20+ assignments and literally are nor bothered by the fact that they’re failing. On essay questions, they will write “I don’t care” as their answer and not give a single F that they score 0 points. I live in a very rural area and literacy, grammar, and reading in general are not valued. What I do is not valued. Not by students or their parents. 

My biggest area of weakness is discipline. I am non-confrontational in general, and I feel as though all I do is struggle with students. I have a notoriously wild and disrespectful group of juniors this year, and they have sucked my will to continue right out of me. I had one today ask to go the cafeteria and I told him I didn’t think that’s where he was really going. He said, “Well that sounds like YOUR problem.” I have an amazing principal who supports me, but he can only do so much. I am a very soft-hearted and sensitive person and I have MASSIVE anxiety. Conflict after conflict with these kids is wrecking me emotionally and mentally. 

I have tried every anxiety medication in the market and they all give me restless leg syndrome. Then I REALLY can’t sleep.

I finally got up the courage and went with the advice that the majority of you gave me. I went to the police. The guilt I felt for not reporting it was weighing heavily on my conscience.

My reason for going to the police was to ensure that this student does not re-offend. The majority of teachers at this school are female, and the girls who attend are as young as 11.

I've been in contact with an unbelievably sympathetic and understanding detective. She filed an official report, and she keeps reaffirming that I did the right thing. The school failed to report the incident and, as mandated reporters, they did not file any of the necessary paperwork.

I had a meeting with the principal already set up, but, as soon as the detective called the school, the entire administration tried to ambush me. I told them I would not meet with all of them at once. Thankfully, they left, and I only met with the principal.

I was in tears during the entirety of the meeting. Every time I brought up my concerns about this student potentially re-offending, the principal literally told me that this was my ""imagination"" or that I was creating these false scenarios in my mind.

Where I go from here I do not know.

I want to thank you all for your advice and support.

**Edit: I forgot to mention this in my post. The school is also now denying that this happened at all to my colleague. They ""were never able to find"" the camera footage of the assault on her, because she did not come forward the day it happened like I did. It is documented that this student assaulted her, as she had to make an official written statement. Now, they are telling the detective investigating the case that it never even happened.

I had some interviews yesterday and a job fair the next day lined up in North Carolina, my home town and where my fiancé lives. 

Interview 1 goes well. It wasn’t my first choice (not that I’m picky, but it’s a much longer drive than other schools) but it was good and I got my nerves out for later. 

Later was when I had my top pick interview. The school is the elementary to my fiancé’s high school (he’s a band director). My fiancé really wanted me to land this job, which only opened because the previous teacher was in the reserves and was called out to protect the border. If I were to get this job, I wouldn’t receive an offer for another week or so because the county requires the job fair be held before offers are given. The job fair was today. 

I went to this interview, tired (10 hour drive the day prior, anxiety and my fiancé’s very bad snoring gave me about three hours of sleep). I was a little spacey but felt more prepared. I had good questions and the principal made me very comfortable and welcome. He talked me through the schedule and I told him about my internship and teaching methods I found effective. He showed me the room, there’s a good amount of instruments though none are particularly new. There were some older orff instruments (it’s a start for sure), LOTS of auxiliary percussion, world drums, a set of ukuleles (which I play and have always wanted to teach in class), and ZITHERS. ain’t seen that shit since the 90s. And they’re in good condition. 

Anyway, it went well, we communicated well, I offered ideas he liked and showed plenty of enthusiasm and interest. He hit me with the “well” you always hear that ends a conversation. I’m expecting “we will let you know” or “we’ll be in touch” 
 
Nope. 

He goes “I don’t know why. But I trust you. I want to go ahead and extend the offer.” 

holyshitwhat.jpeg 

I excitedly accepted. When I told my fiancé he screamed. We can carpool, I can help encourage students to continue in music and he wants to help teach my classes too—and this county (unlike the first school) has one of the HIGHEST LOCAL SUPPLEMENTS IN THE STATE AND HIGHEST BENEFITS. The county of my other school I interviewed for was literally half and non-increasing with experience. 

I can’t believe things worked out so well. I want to announce it so badly but nothing is official yet obviously so I just have to do the semi-anon thing and geek out about it here. I want to go in and start reorganizing my classroom and taking inventory right now! But I have to get married and move first. It’ll happen soon enough. I’m just amazed that I got so incredibly lucky.

I felt like I learned so much more from those exchanges than I ever did in public school, so I’ve been dying to do them this year. 

It finally happened — my kids (5th grade) were engaged and responding to/challenging ideas rather than people, citing evidence, and making personal connections. 

This is the best day I’ve had all year, and gives me a little bit of light that maybe I can continue in this profession. ",false,8bt1c1,,0,,false,1529584587,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/8bt1c1/i_finally_got_my_classroom_management_under/,t3_8bt1c1,,,,

Has anyone ever experienced/heard from other coworkers who have gone through this?,"I have not been able to find anyone to talk to about this, anyone who has gone through the same thing. (I have one coworker who was assaulted by the same student, but we are both entrenched in the same school culture.) I am looking for an outside perspective.

Putting every other issue aside in terms of lack of oversight and how this school treats its teachers and employees poorly, I would like to bring up something very specific that happened. I fear that if I give too much detail, I am at risk of being found out.

Essentially, I was sexually assaulted by a student. I went to administration, and the issue was ""handled"" by calling a meeting, quietly suspending the student for 5 days, and brushing everything else under the rug. I did not call the cops or press charges. This happened recently (within the last two months). My coming forward prompted a different teacher to come forward as well. He had done the same thing to her. She had less proof.

Since then, administration does not speak about what happened. I am still deeply upset and having a hard time getting over/handling what happened. I dread going to work every day. If I see the student in the hall, I turn and walk the other way. I avoid certain exits and areas of the school.

Because this is a charter school, and one particularly notorious for its lack of transparency, I feel as if I have no official channel to go through. I feel the handling of the incident was poor and inadequate. Since then, I was given a less than stellar mid-year review, and I am almost sure they will not contract me for rehire next year due to this.

I am essentially looking for moral support or advice on how to handle this.",false,8am8pk,,0,,false,1529563362,false,self,t5_2qyj9,false,,,false,true,,/r/teaching/comments/8am8pk/im_a_high_school_teacher_who_was_sexually/,t3_8am8pk,,,,

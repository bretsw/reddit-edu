I work with some professors of the faculty of Philosophy. I'm the EdTech specialist that helps them with the online version of its course.

The bibliography for this course is a series of resources put together by them, which are essentially a collection of quotes by classic authors, some other quotes by classic analysts of said authors and commentary from these professors. They want the students to work with primary and secondary sources, and to interpret the texts intertwining multiple voices.

In the print version this is done using footnotes and text balloons, but they want something where you can read the main text and open an emerging paratext and have them side by side, so you can go back and forth.

Do you know any tool that I can use to create this type of texts? It's mandatory that is compatible with Moodle and that it doesn't require to exit the online campus or create an user. I thought about writing tooltips on HTML but it's doesn't exactly fulfill the need and also I think my Moodle version doesn't support that HTML functionality either.

One example that I'd provide is [Incredibox](http://www.incredibox.com/). This site is great because there is nothing else on it and it's focused entirely on exploring music. In my opinion this is a better experience than [Cool Math Games](http://www.coolmath-games.com/).

They never finish their homework and refuse to answer questions in class etc. 

Her school has a merit system to deal with things like this. So kids can be warned they will lose their merit for the week if they aren't working properly. But when threatened with the merit being taken away, they simply don't care. If the merit is taken away they aren't allowed to go on any school trips that year and a text is sent to their parents. 

In addition to this, she has a child with ADHD. From the work I have seen this child do, it seems like she is trying her best. She also has dyslexia so we have to spend some time trying to understand her work, but that's ok. The child with ADHD often has tantrums and spends a lot of time with her head on the desk in class. 

Do you guys have any ways to help the child with ADHD at all? I don't know how my friend could help her but I hope there is some way to do so because her work shows she is a good student. 

And, does anyone know any way to get the other kids motivated at all?

Some cards were color-coded based on the recommended technique. Say, light blue means ""use the trick for multiply by 9"", and red is ""just memorize it, there is no trick."" One side of the board has numbers 1-100 in all black (hard mode), while with the other side, the light blue cards go on the light blue numbers (easy mode).

There was also an associated addition game, with a board 1-20.

Many young people have a really hard time expressing themselves effectively in an interview. And quite often it’s mostly because they just don’t know the “tricks of the trade.” To truly nail a job interview your students need three things \- the right questions to practice, an understanding of how to answer those questions effectively, and feedback on the job interview answers they are giving in their interviews. Boldvue aims to address these three needs.

When your students log into Boldvue, they’ll see videos of other people who have answered job interview questions (kind of like youtube). From watching these videos, they’ll learn what works (and doesn’t) in giving effective answers. They’ll see how others tell stories, what kind of mannerisms they use, the length of answer they should shoot for and much more. Afterwards, they can record themselves answering job interview questions and get feedback! They can share these videos publicly with the Boldvue community or privately with their classmates, friends and family, who will then rate their video and give them the feedback they need to improve their answer. 

If you are in a position where you are helping students find jobs or preparing them for the workforce, you should try using Boldvue!

Dear Sir or Madam, You are invited to participate in a research study for U.S. K-12 pre-service teachers entitled Investigation of COA-IIIA Score Reliability and Validity Among Pre-Service Teachers being conducted by Chris Kraner, a graduate student, and Todd Reeves, a faculty member, at Northern Illinois University. The purpose of the study is to examine the psychometric properties (reliability and validity) of the Conceptions of Assessment III—Abridged instrument among U.S. K-12 pre-service teachers.
 
&amp;nbsp;

The study will involve completion of an online survey about your beliefs about assessment, your beliefs about data, and your educational and demographic characteristics. The online survey should take about 15 minutes to complete. The information you individually provide will not be shared with the teacher preparation program in which you are enrolled. Participation requires that an individual is at least 18 years of age and is a U.S. K-12 pre-service teacher (i.e., enrolled in an accredited post-secondary instruction program leading to teacher licensure). If you choose to participate in the study, you will be able to enter into a drawing for 1 of 3 Amazon Echo Dots.

About seven months ago (close to three in character years), we released [*Model Hogwarts*](http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki), a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) role-playing simulation for wizards and witches who *just* missed their acceptance letters. Just to catch you up:  

The Model so far has been a resounding success! Classes have been going by fairly consistently for the duration of the model, we have active players roleplaying every day and the model continues to refine itself mechanically, with a full spellcasting system capable of allowing you to practise and cast pretty much any spell in the Harry Potter canon-and quite a few more besides! 

We’ve also had three years of consistent storytelling, with each IC year boasting a self-contained narrative arc that includes everyone and helps to really emphasise the spirit of adventure and magic at the heart of the setting, along with some seeds being sown for a wider arc spanning multiple years. The students have had big wins, like talking down a murderous ghost and convincing him to join the staff (don’t ask), big losses, like the time the students were manipulated into resurrecting a powerful serial killer and releasing her into the world (really, don’t ask) and much more besides!

Regarding classes, we have all the basics like Charms, DADA, Transfiguration, Potions, etc as well as a few original world-building classes like Path To Success. We’re also offering electives to third years and up! The reason we are posting this ad today is that due to the growth of the model, we need more than one professor per subject, so we are opening up applications for all subjects!

##**Why are we advertising on /r/teachingresources?**

We’re advertising here because we view this as an opportunity for teachers who are Harry Potter fans to get to hone in their teaching skills in a fun environment! The professor team often looks at and uses resources mentioned on the subreddit, and we think that having people with real-life teaching experience could help us make the class component of Model Hogwarts even better! We are looking for a diverse range of teachers with varying skill sets to help give each class a unique feel. We also have a very diverse range of students of all ages from countries all over the world! We’ve been known to discuss real world problems, as well as comparing class structures in other countries!

##**What this means for you as a professor?**

You get to join a team of super passionate teachers who want you to succeed in whatever subject you want to teach! You get access to a castle of students (we currently have about 125 active students!)  and as much creativity as you can dream of. You would teach one one hour class a week, depending on your availability and the availability of your students, you may teach one or multiple years, either first, second, third or fourth years, depending on what is decided by you and your colleagues. You get a small class size of 5-20 on average of engaged students (depending on the year).

##**What do you need to be a professor?**

First of all, you need to love Harry Potter. You need to be willing to devote an hour or two every week to classes and our weekly staff meeting, but we hope you’ll have so much fun that you’ll stay longer. You need to be passionate about making this project succeed, and invested in its future. You need to be able to work well with others, and be creative!

So, if you’re interested, apply! We’d love to have you, so start packing your suitcase, Hogwarts offers a great (*very safe*) opportunity for teachers, and is world renown!

This is only my second year as a teacher and I've been feeling underwhelmed with my most of co-workers by their lack of imagination or willingness to engage on this topic. My admins are trying to inspire us to develop our own methods for our different fields, but they've been getting mostly complaints. I'm hoping this community can shed some creative insights on methods that have already been tried and what made them successful or unsuccessful. 

My goal is to connect course standards to literally everything I do in class: warm-ups; notes; homework; quizzes and tests; digital resources; labs and projects; grades; etc. The aim, ultimately, is to be able to use all this collected data to guide instruction: to highlight which students misunderstood which topics; adapt to learning styles; benefit student engagement; allow my courses to become more adaptable, student-driven (increasing student choice and voice), and differentiated; and allocate resourses and teacher-attention to students most at risk of falling behind. I expect that accomplishing these goals would ultimately raise student test scores and reduce stress and frustration for both students and teachers. 

My hope is this thread will help me make more visible to my students: What they already know; what they need to review; where to go to learn the material (especially in a more independent -- maybe flipped classroom style -- manor); and what they still need to learn in order to earn an A.

Because I am a computer scientist, and not a language researcher/teacher, my thesis won't necessarily depend that much on the quality of my content (but more on the technical aspects of the app). However, if I use very poor content, I am sure it will distract from other parts of the app.

I have been googling for content for several days now, but it's not straightforward to find recourses which can be used as a content creator/researcher, as nearly everything that shows up is aimed at students. The best I could find, are several lists of most frequently used words on wiktionary, but I feel like I need additional recourses as well.

So my questions are: Do you know of any good resources that fit my purpose? What is the legality of using existing text books as recourse to create my own content with (for non-commerical/ research purpose)?

So I'm in a VERY complicated situation where I haven't learned anything in the past 3 years and I'm attempting to enter one of the  best high schools in my country before December 20th. To top it off, I'm gonna have to do extremely well in the entrance exam because I will have just finished 8th grade by December and I would be entering halfway through 9th grade(yes, I would be skipping half of 9th grade) because the school I want to enter has a different calendar. Also, it's one of the few schools in the country where you have to take the IGCSE, so I have to study for that as well in case I do get in.

The school I'm in right now is probably one of the worst in the country (seriously)and I was not learning anything here, so I spoke to the principal and he told me I could just stay at home and learn by myself but also I have to hand in the homework every Wednesday (it's only a short guide per week, which I can finish in under an hour, so I have basically the whole week to focus on studying)in order to pass the year. My tutor is helping me with this but we only see each other 4 days a week, so he organized a schedule for me to follow every day and he leaves me homework that he checks when we meet. There are 3 of problems:
1. I'm lazy and I procrastinate a lot.
2. I'm a bit of a slow learner.
3. I could only manage to get the seventh grade topics via a friend of mine that studies there, so I have no idea what to study for 6th and 8th grade.

The main subjects that I know are taught in that school are:
-Spanish
-English 
-French
-Social Studies
-Science(chemistry, I think?)
-Math(algebra)

For those of you wondering why I want to enter that school it's because I want to study architecture abroad and since that's the only school in my city that has the IGCSE and the A levels, getting good grades or even having those will give me a huge advantage over the other MEXT Scholarship applicants in my country. Also, their education is great so I will undoubtedly be prepared for the MEXT Scholarship exams and for college.

I'm very anxious over this and I've had several panic attacks because I couldn't forgive myself if ended up not getting in(I ended up in this situation in the first place because of some very bad decisions I made in the past), so please, any recommendations (resources, tips, books, websites, apps)would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time,
                                           ~Diego

There is also a mode where everything is managed on the teacher's computer instead, I generally think the first mode is superior, but only for high school and up as it requires a certain level of maturity for the students to manage, which is the age group I had in mind anyway.

The students then submit a list of preferences as to who they want to be in a group with the first person in the list is the one they want to team up with the most, second person, second most and so on.

Finally the teacher specifies group sizes or the amount of groups and the groups will be generated maximizing the satisfaction based on preferences. Students that have been in a group together before are less likely to end up in the same group again.

I'm looking for activities like:

Where students are introduced to a situation which later provokes critical thinking and discussion about an assumption they make about the world. I've found these to be fun ways to launch our community building hours as we work to make a 'team' of my class.


One example that I've already done with my class is:

Each student gets a dot sticker placed on their forehead. They're told to make groups without talking or seeing their own sticker.

They usually 'figure out' that they can make groups by pairing other people with the same color. Eventually the groups are all pleased to be standing with the other students with the same color sticker.

Later we discuss ""why did we pick those groups"", since the instructions don't explicitly say to choose by color. We also discuss how did it feel to be put into a group by others... things like that.

Anyways, I'd love to hear if you have any similar ideas that have worked well in your classroom!

As part of this, I would like to start an English Club for non-native speakers, ranging from 9th to 10th grade. I plan on having our first meeting this week to gauge what students wish to get out of the course. However, I am also curious to hear if anyone has done something like this before and if they have any suggestions? The club would meet twice a week for roughly forty minutes.

I am a current graduate student at Georgia Tech and I am writing a research paper for my Educational Technology class on technology training programs for teachers. I posted a survey a couple weeks ago and received a great deal of responses, thanks so much! 

I am conducting another round of surveys focusing more specifically on elements of training programs, as I realized (while analyzing my data for my paper outline) that my original survey content lacked this. 

I am looking for current teachers to take a short survey (3-5 minutes long). The purpose of this survey and research is to determine what the differences are between schools (public, private, charter, etc) and the technology training programs provided to teachers. My research will be finalized and submitted next week; your response and time is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

I absolutely love using technology in my classroom and think that with the right training, you will too. Most teachers, however, are simply not aware of the awesome tools that exist to make their lives way easier, and their classroom environment much more exciting.

There's plenty of super useful stuff you can do, including automating loads of your busy work and communicating very fast with students &amp; parents on issues.

I want to show you how - and hence the reason why I've created this completely free course that takes just a week to complete.

Aims:
• I can create texture by using the wax rubbing technique
• I can create texture by selecting lighter and darker shades
Success Criteria:
• I can cut and organise my pieces before I stick them. • I can use objects to create prints.
Resources:
• Tree bark, images of forests, A4 brown sugar paper and black crayons with paper wrapping removed. A4 black card or paper. Yellow and green ready mixed paint in lighter and darker shades. A variety of objects to make leaf prints; cotton buds, the end of felt pens with lids on, small scrunched up balls of paper etc
Opportunities for Re ective Learning:
How do you think what you have learned today will affect your art work in the future? Can you think of anything else you could have used to create texture?
Introduction:
Show children a piece of tree bark. Let the children pass it around and feel the texture of the surface. Can they think of any good words to describe the texture? Can they guess why trees have bark around their trunks? Explain how the bark is a protective layer for the tree keeping the more delicate wood inside safe from animals and insects.
Teaching Session 1:
Tell the children they are going to use crayons to create trees that are textured like bark. Demonstrate using a wax crayon on its side. Placing paper on top of the bark and rubbing. What do the children think of the effect? Should you add more crayon? Is all of the paper textured? Demonstrate cutting carefully from the bottom, to the top of the page to create long tree trunks. Explain that the trunks can be thick or thin. They can be very straight or a little bendy and that trees are all very different.
Demonstrate placing a selection of the trunks on black paper to create a forest. Encourage the children to help you decide how to place the tree trunks; do they think you have used too many trees? Should you use only 3 or would the picture look better with 4? Which tree trunks should you use the thinner ones, the really thick ones or a combination of both? When ready stick the trees into place.
Ask the children to create their own woodland picture. Remind the children to keep the tree trunks the same length so that they can be stuck from the bottom to the top of their paper.
Teaching Session 2:
Show the children images of forests. Can they see the shape of the leaves? Are the leaves all exactly the same colour? Why are the leaves at the top lighter? Explain that we can’t see the shapes of the leaves because they are far away.
Explain that you are going to make leaves for your tree by printing. Demonstrate using your  nger to dab spots of green paint at the top of the tree trunks. Ask the children how could you show that some of the leaves are lighter and some are darker? Demonstrate by adding darker green/ blue and lighter green/ yellow. Tell the children that if they would prefer they could use something else from the table to make leaf prints.
Ask the children to add leaves to their woodland picture.
Remind the children to keep cleaning their printing objects or  ngers on paper towels.

They were a hit with my students, and so I uploaded them to Teachers Pay Teachers. They never got any downloads, and I'm bad at marketing myself, so I've pretty much given up trying to make a business out of it. Most people seem to prefer tried and true print-outs and posters over interactive media. Anyway, I figured I'd post here, in case anyone wanted to give my games a look over. I'll describe them below, and if you are interested in downloading either one, just send me a message and I'll give it away for free.

One video game has to do with taxonomy, and the classification of animals, while the other is a murder mystery which acts as a literacy activity. Both were for ESL classes, so the language can be a bit simple, but they should be able to be used in non-ESL classrooms as well.

Here is the taxonomy game:

This is a nice, free activity that requires almost no prep time, and lets students use their phone cameras to do a bit of algebra! [Phone Camera Math](http://tutorminute.com/phone/2017/10/14/phone-camera-math.html)

It's great for after midterms when you want to keep students engaged but reward them with something fun. Also great to keep in your repertoire for one of those days when vacation is coming up, the kids are bouncing off the walls and you need a break :)

They need their camera phones and a measuring stick. (Could be nice to use a measuring app as well). The technique can be used to find the distance to random objects inside the classroom. Once they get practice on this, use it to find distance to far away objects- we tested it on planes heading to the local airport, and cars on the street.

Skills practiced are: unit conversion, and solving a proportion for an unknown variable.

Hope this is helpful! As a teacher, my goal is to create content-rich activities that can be done with very little prep time or materials. Would love to hear your feedback.",,76qy1g,,0,,false,1510442173,false,self,t5_2w9jj,false,secondary maths,,false,true,,/r/teachingresources/comments/76qy1g/grade_612_phone_camera_math_activity_xpost_to/,,,,Mathematics,

Just wanted to contribute to the community that I've lurked in and grabbed so much neat stuff from.

My maths youtube channel is [joelsperanzamath](https://www.youtube.com/c/joelsperanzamath)

You'll find about 600 odd videos here ranging from grade 8 to grade 12 mathematics. These videos were all made for my own classes. 

I currently teach year 10B (right now, simultaneous equations), 11B (mostly calculus) and 12 math C (at the moment we're about to start proof by induction) so I'll be adding about ten videos a week or so throughout the school term.

Have a browse, you'll probably find something you can use. If you go searching for something and can't find it, let me know. Maybe I'll make one!

There still remain a lot of topics to cover and improvements to make. Hopefully, someday we'll be there :).

They've finally dried out enough to be handled, so I would like them to get handled! When I was a kid in school, I always loved when my teacher had something physical to go with our discussion. Physical objects you can touch made my lessons real.

[Here's a photo gallery of the fossils.](https://imgur.com/gallery/M7pY9)

So I've got 15 or so good fossils here with nice clearly visible ferns that I want to give away. Many of them are two sided or feature more than one fern. These are all from the Carboniferous era, approximately 300 million years ago. The stone itself is shale from the Mahoning shale in the Glenshaw formation, and I can provide a great deal of geology information to go with the fossils.

Unfortunately, I'm not a wealthy man. I'll give these specimens away for free. I'll wrap them up, pack them gently, and address the box, but maybe you could pay for shipping? A pound or so in a box the size of a book doesn't cost much to ship, but 10-15 times adds up. If your school has a ups number, great, or email me a shipping label you can create on the USPS website. I'm not asking for any cash, I could never ask a teacher for money, just an address and a label.

I'll leave this offer open for a few days before finalizing who gets what, I'd like to give people who may not be on Reddit monday night a chance to see it, and if there are more people that want specimens for their classrooms than I have (I don't know how active this sub is or how many people would be interested), I'm definitely willing to donate another Saturday to the cause and go find some more.

If anyone here is in or around Pittsburgh PA, I'd love to show you where I got these. It's not suitable for a field trip because it is beside a road, but the fossils are so plentiful you could easily collect enough to give one to each of your kids and maybe spark a lifetime love of learning.


EDIT; Wednesday March 28, 2018, I've sent PM's to everyone who replied so far, promising them a few each. If anyone else finds this post in the future, please message me and I'll make a trip back to the site to dig up some more for your classroom. I enjoy fossils and paleontology as a hobby, but only have so much space on my mantle and bookshelves (because they're full of books). Going to dig new fossils is a hobby all it's own even if it's for other people, I'll be glad to do it (so long as there's no snow on the ground, shale is slippery).",,87e7ag,,0,,false,1522362062,false,self,t5_2w9jj,false,secondary scie earth,,false,true,,/r/teachingresources/comments/87e7ag/donation_earth_science_free_fossils_for_classrooms/,,,,Earth Science,

It's a savior. Our science department can now create plans, share them amongst our peers, edit existing plans, and essentially do everything you need to including assign assignments to kids if you need! It really is a great resource and I hope that you guys may find it as useful as me!

My name is Nick and I made an app, called Grade Hound, that tells you what you need on upcoming exams/assignments in order to get or maintain certain letter grades in your classes. It’s free for iPhone and iPad.

Grade Hound is being featured on the front page of the App Store right now. To celebrate, I am giving away 10 codes to get the pro version for free. With the pro version you can add unlimited classes (as opposed to a max of 2 with the free version).

I left my IT career of 14 years to join the teaching world last January. After finishing up my student teaching and degree, I landed at a school that is absolutely amazing. I've been lurking here for some time, and have gained tons of wonderful tools to enhance my practice. Thank you for all that you do!

I am looking for a piece of software that can mimic the experience of the old class set of whiteboards. Students have touchscreen chromebooks, and I have a recent Mac laptop, and a smart board/projector. In a perfect world: What I want is for me is for me to give out a problem, which would be pushed to all screens, they would be able to draw on their virtual whiteboards, and I would have the ability to see their current state from my laptop. I feel like that is asking a lot, and I'd be happy to switch up the plan or lower my expectations if you think something could fit an activity like this. 

My 9th graders are learning metric conversions, and many of them struggle mightily with math. Their struggle leads quickly to giving up.

We have created a free app (iOS only currently, but Android coming soon) to capture handwritten teacher marks (utilises computer vision and deep learning) from test papers, which we hope will be useful to many and save a lot of time. 

We have created a video to show how this works, hopefully it's okay to link this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8njo1I0kJoE

App is available here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapgrade/id1225217793?ls=1&amp;mt=8

Usually teachers would write the marks into an Excel spreadsheet and then import into an online system, but you can do that all though the app and get meaningful analysis very quickly. 

Just point the mobile phone at each page individually and it captures the marks from the marks column, and imports it into the system. Teachers can then get analysis on the spot for supported papers, or export as a CSV file for import into their own systems.

We currently support a range of SATs papers which can be downloaded from here https://snapgrade.co.uk/#resources-anchor, or in the next version of the app, teachers will be able to describe and build their own papers giving this application in other parts of the world for pretty much any test paper.

Hi everyone! I am a drum teacher from Firenze, Italy. I mostly teach one on one lessons.
I’m searching for a simple&amp;powerful app to communicate and interact with my students in a variety of ways. I hope someone here could help.

I am currently using Google Classroom, I enjoy it and it represents more or less the type of app that I need: I can pose questions, give assignments, attach audio/video/photo contents in a user-friendly way.
Nonetheless, I feel like this app lacks some features that are necessary, considering my needs.
In G Classroom, I have a classroom made of all my students, who mostly don’t know each other.

I like that in G Classroom, when I want to give assignments or communicate with my students, I can address a generic post to one, some or all of my students.
When I have to share something with someone or pose a question, I can involve more than one student at a time without notifying the whole class: when I share something with a little group - even if the students don’t know each other - since they are often studying similar things, the opportunity to discuss and share even more is always fruitful and very positive overall.

Unfortunately, Classroom doesn’t let students ask direct questions to the teacher. If they want to ask me, tell me, share something with me, they can either comment on some random post, which wouldn’t make sense, given that the app also works as a personal “organizer”, in order to spend less time re-tracing all the topics addressed during the lessons; or they can post something publicly on the classroom wall, thus notifying the entire classroom. This can create some trouble because my classroom is made of
students of all ages and levels, so I don’t want the mother of a 8-year-old beginner to get spam-notified by some nerdy discussion going on between me and my late teen “rockstar” students. Also the reverse is true.
At the same time, I don’t like to have the students’ “posting rights” turned to ‘off’. I don’t want to make this a one-way channel, one where only I can post. It would lose its goal.

At the moment, then, G Classroom is not useful to me, because neither option is viable: spam is not an option, while sharing and discussing is vital to enrich students’ learning and can’t be turned off.
Does anyone know of some better equipped app for my purposes?

PS: Sorry for my English! I hope I explained myself clearly enough.
PS2: Simple messaging apps can’t do the job, because they completely lack the organizational features that benefit both my work and the students’.",,8om067,,0,,false,1536334720,false,self,t5_2w9jj,false,tools misc,,false,true,,/r/teachingresources/comments/8om067/i_am_searching_for_an_app/,,,false,General Tools,

I have many friends who are elementary school teachers and they told me that they wanted an app that would let them have quick and easy access to information about their students such as which ones are in the GATE program, their reading and math levels, and which ones need special accommodations. When you have a class of more than 30 students, it is hard to keep all of this in your head, particularly at the start of the year. With the Class Coach app, you can gather all the most important info about students from various sources/files and keep it all in one place on your phone in a fun and easy to use way. It is useful to have with you at meetings, when trying to group students for an activity, or when planning lessons. 

If you think this app would be useful for you and are browsing reddit on your iphone, you can get a direct link to the app on the App Store (currently iOS only) by clicking the following link:
[itunes.apple.com/us/app/class-coach/id1298270460?mt=8](itunes.apple.com/us/app/class-coach/id1298270460?mt=8)
Otherwise, it will be very difficult to find through a search because it is so new.

Take a look!,"Hello!

I teach International English at a community college near Seattle, and mostly use Kahoot as a fun break in between grammar assignments and less exciting work, as well as to lead into certain projects. While my students aren't quite fluent, they are highly conversational, and I like to create surveys that encourage discussion. 

I have also included some simple, stupid quizzes and surveys I made that are purely for fun (though many of them do have corresponding assignments. If you're curious about a particular Kahoot, feel free to ask me how I follow it up in the comments.)


**The Gullibility Quiz**

This is probably my favorite series. Originally it just started as a dumb kind of game to get the students warmed up, but I began to realize it does have real world application in critical thinking, and not being so quick to believe everything you hear (especially in this day and age.) Essentially, it is a mix of surprising facts that are actually true, and complete bullshit that sounds reasonable.

GQ4 - https://create.kahoot.it/details/gullible-quiz-4/d8627a6c-6631-4ea8-93b7-4b47b13014e5


**Visual Puzzles**

Some simple visual brainteasers I found online. This is good for killing roughly ten minutes.

https://create.kahoot.it/details/visual-puzzles/dc7d4413-5248-481e-929c-43c1f8ce469e


**Happiness Survey**

A little bit less lighthearted, but used to make conversations on what matters in life. With high level students I used to follow this with a lesson about the Experience Machine by Robert Nozick, which is interesting if you like a bit of casual philosophy. 

https://create.kahoot.it/details/happiness/f2ebfee4-4441-4899-9070-b9bb19380a0c


**Genericized Trademarks**

This one is pretty stupid. It is simply a quiz on the actual names of products, compared to what most people call them (such as how much people say 'Chapstick' instead of 'Lip Balm')

https://create.kahoot.it/details/genericized-trademarks/307d7d80-8b27-4154-a457-14410ffd7abf


**Relationship WWYD**

It is important to have a mature class because of the subject matter, but the content itself is fairly clean and innocent.

https://create.kahoot.it/details/relationship-wwyd/7b379d1e-fc47-4c80-9d1c-4de58b9bb5a3


**Debate Prompts**

I do this debate lesson where I assign pairs to very uneven debate prompts. Especially for higher level students, it is a great building exercise to argue for something that is absolute bullshit - I have seen some excellent presentations arguing that Giraffes aren't real, and that Kim Jong Un is more fashionable than Psy. Usually I sprinkle in a couple of serious topics as to not get too wacky. Of course, these quizzes can be duplicated as needed.

https://create.kahoot.it/details/dumb-debate-4/668b4060-c261-4b8b-b455-3aed82ca66af


**How to Survive an Animal Attack**

This one is always a favorite. You might want to read up some articles to explain the reasoning behind some of the answers. In this revised version, I tried to include some statistics to make it more educational, but I'll admit some of those may require revision.

https://create.kahoot.it/details/duplicate-of-how-to-survive-an-animal-attack/aee9f73c-f77d-4790-be88-07f789209189


**Wacky Japanese Inventions**

I used to follow this up with an assignment where they had to create some dumbass infomercial product and create an advertisement for it, but it never went over very well with the students who had less creativity. The kahoot itself can still be used for a variety of things, such as 3rd conditionals (If I had this, I could XYZ)

https://create.kahoot.it/details/wacky-japanese-inventions/762ed7e7-493c-43f3-9ad4-52b27b155f9f


**Would you rather**

This one is just weird, I stole a lot of the questions from here on reddit, and made up some other ones. Protip, for the Elbows/Knees questions, have students who choose to have non-bending knees sit up, then try to sit down - and the students who choose elbows to try brushing their teeth. It's always hilarious.

https://create.kahoot.it/details/would-you-rather/af3277e6-aa8e-4165-aa00-9931d2abe4d1


**Coal or Presents** 

I made this for Christmas, but you can put it on your backlog, or save it for July. It was actually a lot of fun, and wish I didn't have to wait 11 months to do it again.

https://create.kahoot.it/details/coal-or-presents/ce1391f6-f262-4bda-81e4-4303bbfd830f


**Comfortable Quiz**

This one involves how comfortable you feel in different social situations.

https://create.kahoot.it/details/comfortable-quiz/e1381d98-841f-4d2d-b242-9cb71ce9dee2


**Blame Game**

This is one of my personal favorites. Though it must be duplicated and the final question must be edited to fit your class (it's a joke question)

https://create.kahoot.it/details/blame-game/a6324d6e-2221-4994-8e13-2bf52bd0b778


That is about it for now. I have an absolute ton of Kahoots in my favorite section that I have taken from other creaters, but will leave this post as is. Feel free to use them and duplicate as need be. I should warn that many of them are personalized using either my name, my schools name, or sometimes students, so make sure to look over thoroughly before use. 

Enjoy!

I live in Brazil. I've just had my first experience teaching kids under 4 years old. Many students were going to school for the first time. A little boy started to cry and I checked up on him to see if he was fine..then he said that wanted to go home or even see his sister (who is older and study in the same school). I said he mom would come later..then he started to cry louder and louder...and get angry..and I got close to him and said ""come..stop crying your mom is coming..look at me...when he looked at me he fucking slapped my face. I know he is a little boy and didn't do it on purpose because he was scared of the classroom..however, the other students saw that scene and I am worried that I will lose control over my students. What should I do? Meanwhile, there were other students crying missing their moms. Truth be told, I am not really good at pedagogy and I feel like a new daddy of many students (plus, I have never taked cared of a baby before or anything like that). If it is not asking too much, can you guys suggest some sites, links, or subreddits that other kindergarten teachers can help me with tips?

A fellow teacher and I have created ""The Human Restoration Project."" We just made ourselves a Reddit account and look forward to getting to know everyone.

Here's what we have!

**Research**: We back all of our opinions by building up progressive research articles. Here's that: http://www.humanrestorationproject.org/compilation-of-research/

**Blog**: We issue all of our thoughts on Medium (and our website): https://medium.com/human-restoration-project

**Podcast**: ""Things Fall Apart"" is our podcast series with interviews with progressive educators. It's on iTunes, Stitcher, etc.!: https://www.podbean.com/site/userCenter

**Resources**: We have a free resource guide to get people started with progressive ed.: http://www.humanrestorationproject.org/primer/

as well as resources for our supporters on Patreon! Right now we're offering a major project, multiple packets for leading guided PD, and various other things on a subscription basis through *Restoration Boxes*.

Our **April Restoration Box** includes a guide for implementing genius hour via PBL-PD, a guide to self-directed learning, and controlling organized chaos. Our previous **March Restoration Box** has a massive project for exploring student passions and PD over utilizing *your* own passions.

Consider supporting us on Patreon! You aren't billed until the end of the month, so feel free to take our resources and judge for yourself! Next month will be a builder for true PBL! https://www.patreon.com/theHumanRestorationProject

As teachers ourselves, we greatly appreciate what everyone does to be the best educator possible - our children deserve it! We'll hopefully help you conduct, explore, research, and implement *best practice* in your classroom! 

Thanks! - Chris &amp; Michael

Could someone please explain to me how the Spelling Bee program is supposed to work? My daughter won for her grade, but it seems her school does not participate any further than that.

How do students get to the national level? Are there any known reasons why a public grade school would not participate further? Is the Bee on the same day across the nation? Are the leveled wordlists the same for everyone? Are the example sentences provided for the teachers or do they make up their own?

What are the rules? I noticed that there was a second teacher who would write down what the kids said so that there'd be a second judge on whether or not they recited the correct letters... Are there any other regulations that parents aren't normally privy to?  

What happens if the teacher assigning the words makes a mistake? My daughter's teacher kept pronouncing the word 'primers' like ""primmers"", which took 2 kids out (I realize that both pronunciations are acceptable, but I've never in my life heard anyone use this short 'i' pronunciation, and judging by the sea of confused faces in the audience, I'm not alone).",false,8lsgcp,,0,,false,1529764969,false,self,t5_2w9jj,false,QorD misc,,false,true,,/r/teachingresources/comments/8lsgcp/spelling_bee_process/,t3_8lsgcp,,,Discussion / Question,

I'm a teacher who teaches 13-16 year olds in Sweden. I'd like to incorporate gamification as a tool to motivate my students, and I have a pretty specific idea about how to do it.

I want the focus of the program to be about something my students can progress with - like an avatar that improves and gets better gear, or a town which they can build from the ground up.
I want to be able to be the administrator for my students, and I want to give them tasks. The tasks would not be preformed in the program, instead I'd like to be able to customize the tasks I give them. Like for example ""Answer these 3 questions with atleast 3 sentences per answer"", or ""Divide your text in multiple paragraphs"". Once the students would feel like they've accomplished a task, they'd check that in the program. I then, as the administrator, should then be able to approve that they infact have completed the task.

Once a student completes a task, they would get a reward. Best of all would be if the reward had some sort of RNG-factor. Lootboxes, multipliers, I dunno.

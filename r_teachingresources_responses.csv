This new sub is recruiter-free. Thus there is no hype, no censorship, and no sugar-coated BS. See for yourself.  BTW... this sub also has the very best TEFL job contract template I have ever seen (bullet-proof!).",,,,YankInChina,,,1499514248,t5_2w9jj,t3_6m0jks,t3_6m0jks,-1,1501062367,0,0,djxywiu,teachingresources,,,

"Code Academy and Codecombat.com are good for learning programming.

Look into LEGO Robotics for, well, robotics. It's a great platform because it can go from pretty basic (icon based programming and pre-planned robots) to much more robust (C or Java programming, and make your own robots). Plus, there are competitions!

Arduinos and Circuit Playgrounds are both great platforms for learning about circuitry with programming.

Circuit breadboards are a great way to learn about circuits without programming (building a circuit to light a light, or even a basic AM radio, etc.)",,,,imatschoolyo,,,1499975384,t5_2w9jj,t3_6n3p1p,t3_6n3p1p,2,1501219735,0,0,dk6k2ax,teachingresources,,,

"First off, learning to code won't pull in many people. Coding isn't exciting or anything, so don't focus on that. If kids are interested in coding then point them to google or one of the many free coding sites.

Focus on the hardware aspect. Go to your local IT and tech stores to see if they have extra gear. Put it all in a box and start from there. Go to the junk yard and see if there are any computers, I've picked up two really good computers from junkyards.

Ideally I would start off with a working computer. Then show them basic maintenance stuff. Hardware and software. Cleaning and upgrading too.

Then once everyone is up to speed on it. You could try to get gen to volunteer and clean up all of the library computers. I mean really it would just be spraying compressed air, resetting RAM/video/sound cards, and maybe looking for potential issues. 

Realistically though, find the kids who want to be in IT club and ask them what they want to do. Let them figure out projects. I would try to start with what I said, just to get them familiar with tech in general... but hey, after that build a robot or something.

As far as starting the club, ask your principal about any paperwork you might need to do. Then make a flyer and post it around the school, tell the kids in your class about it.",,,,BorisTheMagical,,,1500033540,t5_2w9jj,t3_6n3p1p,t3_6n3p1p,1,1501236847,0,0,dk7irhc,teachingresources,,,

I know a lot of teachers who stopped working to raise their children and have completely adjusted to working again now. Your mom might want to find out what kind of technology will be available in her classroom so she can plan how she'd use it.

Barnes and Noble has a GREAT membership card for teachers. It's 100% free and actually gives you bigger discounts than the paid membership. All you need is a school ID and (possibly) a pay stub from your school.

As for books, I recommend you read:
The First Days of School by Harry Wong (classroom management, classroom setup, etc.)
Assertive Discipline by Forget Author's Name

Some of the best teachers I've taught with didn't have a teaching degree, but they had a lot of common sense and expertise. Sometimes teaching degrees disconnect you so much from reality you have no idea what you're doing in front of real, living kids.

"In my experience teacher discounts are not restricted to people with teaching degrees, or people at public schools. They just ask for proof of employment as a teacher (school ID usually, but sometimes a pay stub or something else will work) and the fine print usually says that it includes staff at public and private schools. I didn't learn about any from my teaching program, I found out about them from signs in stores or from asking. I will just carry my school ID with me and if it seems appropriate I will ask if they happen to have a teacher discount. 

In my experience craft stores, book stores, and office supply stores often have teacher discounts. Here's a list to get you started. I'm not sure if it's good outside the US but it was published this year so it's probably pretty accurate. Good luck ☺️

"Oh Scotland I went there last summer! It was amazing, such beautiful mountains! Got up to Orkney islands and everything!

That's really tough though, it seems like these kids won't be prepared for the real world, and never have consequences for their actions/inactions. I wonder why they don't care about not being able to do anything after...maybe they don't know life can be better? Maybe tell them they can make decent money doing trade jobs  but you need to know how to write? But honestly these kids are so young I do not know if they are thinking about jobs right now....I only have experience with 12-15 year old kids. 

But there has been 3 things that I have seen that works besides threatening with not graduating. But they have different results with different kids some need all 3.

1. Applicable skills. Kids need to know that what they learn in the classroom they will need for everyday life in the future. I always use current day situations as examples. I also show my kids YouTube videos of people not knowing things we learned on live TV etc. to encourage them and also I make fun of those people on the video and say that they will need to work at Mc Donald's for the rest of their lives and if they learn this they can work at somewhere that's better than McDonalds.

2. Growth mindset so kids don't get discouraged if they don't do well on some things. (The principal of growth mindset is that we are not born knowing everything we need to know and learn and everything has compounding interest when we learn new things) 

3. This is probably the hardest one of all. She needs to personally want them to succeed not only in her class but in life and show the kids this. She needs to know their goals, what they want to do and use that knowledge to get them motivated. She needs to build the relationships so that her students will want to do well to please her and so that she can be proud of them maybe make little assignments that they can do well on give them treats and gradually up the ante.

"I started using this this year because it seemed like last year we had a lot of testing and last minute changes that pushed lessons around. It was annoying to rewrite all the dates in a planner and such. I chose to use one these programs because it's easy to push lessons back and automatically push them ALL back, but if you have specific ones that need to be on a specific date (for us, each subject has a specific day of the week for tests) you can anchor them so they won't get pushed.

"**Proud Boys**

Proud Boys is a far right men's organization founded in 2016 by Vice Media co-founder and former commentator Gavin McInnes. McInnes describes the organization as a ""pro-Western fraternal organization"" for men who ""refuse to apologize for creating the modern world."" The group has been referred to as alt-right or alt-lite.

The group takes its name from the showtune ""Proud of Your Boy,"" a song introduced in the 2011 stage-show version of Disney's Aladdin.

In 2017, Kyle Chapman, with the full approval of McInnes, formed a ""street fighting"" wing of the Proud Boys called the Fraternal Order of the Alt-Knights (FOAK).

"Usually you have to show some proof of address to get a library card, but if you don't have a permanent address, just ask a librarian to help you out. Different libraries have different policies about how you get a card. Like I said in my first comment, you're a librarian's dream! Whoever is working the information desk at your local library will be happy to help. (On the offchance they're not, just ask a different one. Don't be intimidated.)

If the library doesn't have exactly what you need, they can get it for you through what's called interlibrary loan, where they request it from another branch or system. I'm not sure about library-by-mail, though that sounds great, like old-school Netflix for books!

In terms of keeping it simple, start with introductory books. They'll have boring titles like *All About Astronomy* or *Introduction to Trigonometry.* Once you've gotten through an introduction, those books usually have a list at the end of more recommended reading, so you can keep going from there. Even if you're interested in something like philosophy, I would read *about* what you want to learn first, then read the actual primary sources and authors. It's a lot more efficient and will give you the context you need to understand what you're reading.

It's daunting, but doable, to educate yourself about pretty much anything. Just keep an end goal in mind and don't be afraid to ask for help!",,,,drummer_girl,,,1505505217,t5_2w9jj,t3_6yb1jq,t1_dn16uv3,2,1506811126,0,0,dn227wh,teachingresources,,,

&gt; Six years ago, Moss Jefferies’ father was murdered by an Oakland police officer. Along with losing a parent, the media’s vilification of his father and lack of accountability has left Moss with near-debilitating panic attacks.

Constant intimidation and Oakland Police Department officers stationed in their halls. Despite their youth, the students decide to organize and push back against the administration.

I would like to let anyone who sees this to know that it is incredibly important to back up everything you have in multiple places.  
  

&amp;nbsp;
  
This isn't in anyway intended to be a stab at you, but I have worked in two schools, and both of which have had their servers hacked and files stolen by some black hat hackers. They then sent a message stating the school needed to pay $500,000 to have the files back. One of the schools was hacked the last three years in a row... 

&amp;nbsp;

In other words... This is very common. 
Back 'em up for safety!

"First of all, your IT guy needs to be fired. Your stuff should have been backed up twice - once hard, once to the cloud. When you start re-creating things, make sure that you are keeping backups in Google Drive or Dropbox or somewhere. And, because I am a fossil, I also keep a lot of my major stuff in hard copy in a file cabinet. So I've got four levels of backup. 

Second of all, take a deep breath and start working backwards from the units you remember. I have good luck looking for things with a .pdf extension, because they're usually printer-ready. So if you're teaching *The Outsiders* by S.E. Hinton and you want some vocabulary lists to go with it, search ""the outsiders hinton vocabulary pdf"" and see what the Almighty Google returns to you. 

History and math will depend on what you're doing, but if I'd lost everything and had to start all over, I'd start with the databases maintained by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, National Council for the Social Studies, and for English, our major professional organization is the National Council of Teachers of English. They all maintain online repositories of lessons and unit plans for a variety of things. 

There's plenty out there for free, so I wouldn't drop a bunch of money on stuff from TPT or similar unless it was something that I knew was good, or was something that I couldn't get anywhere else or do better on my own. 

Good luck. And I hope your new IT guy is better than your last one. ",,,,gypsy_teacher,,,1506887620,t5_2w9jj,t3_73mjui,t3_73mjui,4,1509213475,0,0,dnrpl4m,teachingresources,,,

"Your IT guy is an idiot. All resources should be backed up off site regularly. 
Check if your colleagues have backed things up into Dropbox, Google drive etc and you might get lucky. Also, there may be an older teacher who prints everything and saves into a binder. There usually is...bless them.

Google your topic and year level, and a few things should come up. Save everything in Dropbox. 

Teachers pay Teachers is good for must have now things and check their free resources. 
Sparklebox has some good free stuff for lower levels. 
English and history- it is better to Google the topic and text. 

If you have textbooks, look online for the teachers guide and resources. 

If it makes you feel better, I had to create every unit, year plan and resource from scratch this year.

"That was honestly depressing for me to read. As a relatively young teacher, I often feel more at home with my high school students than I do with my colleagues. Not only are they more open and less judgemental than the adults, they don't all want to use me for my computer knowledge. I have a simple policy on phones: use them as a tool for education or put them away. My students use their phones, and I give them the benefit of the doubt until I blatantly catch someone. Best part: I don't have to send any notes home or bring in admins. I just tell the kids how disappointed I am that they violated my trust, and that they have ruined it for everyone. Within a day or two, the kids come begging for their beloved ""phones for educational purposes only"" privileges, apologizing and promising it will never happen again. They love me for being lenient, and the kids police each other. I don't have to be the bad guy, and I get to genuinely offer my students respect, trust, fairness, forgiveness, and lessons they'll actually pay attention to.

"Very neat idea.  A potential warning for teachers: contact your school board/principal BEFORE using this app.  While I'm sure the app creator is acting in good faith, uploading student information onto a non-board site CAN be construed in negative ways (lack of control over use of app data, for one).  In some boards you can be held personally liable for the release of student information.  Just a warning.  Looks like it could be a useful app, though!

"I just came across this app and decided to give it a try with my HS juniors (I teach English) as a vocab review.

The app requires one iPad and either a laptop you can airplay to or an Apple TV.

After that, it runs really smoothly and my students loved it. A nice feature is that it tells you how long a game will run (roughly), which helps for planning.

They do take turns and draw while their team (half the class) guesses. The app allows for a maximum of 16 players in a game. Nice thing about Pictionary is that while one person draws, everyone else on the team is also involved with guessing.

"Hey /u/ODGlenchez, that was my bad for making a link post and not commenting after. Here's some more info on the course:

Match Schoolhouse, a nonprofit which provides short online courses aimed at giving busy teachers a new way to boost their skills and content knowledge, is on the brink of launching its very first course. We’re looking to bring together a small group of early access users, who will have the chance to test drive the course - for free. We’ll also provide testers with an Amazon gift card, and a certificate if they successfully complete the assessment. We’re looking to get teachers from different backgrounds, districts, grade levels, and styles of teaching, in order to have a well-rounded sample of experiences with our resource. 

If you’re interested in applying to be a part of the early access group, fill out this form and we’ll get in touch with you shortly! This first course is entitled ""Ratios: All Students Thinking Hard"" and it examines strategies on how to ensure that your students are doing the hard work in the classroom (and not you). The entire course and assessment shouldn’t take more than 2 to 3 hours of your time, and we’ll also ask you to fill out a follow-up survey once completed.

I guess my major problem with this is, I'm from the Philippines and we're not really into football, so basically my students won't even know how to defend their choice, considering the fact that they don't know the nature of the positions they assigned their person to. 

In that case, could I also use another game to associate this technique with? Frankly, I don't really get why the teacher assigned this to me or how she even came across the surface of this idea.

This is usually a small group activity, maybe have students get into pairs and make it seems like one will be testing or keeping track of the others' answers? It's fun and quick, but the message is pretty strong.

"End of year, I do a ""pot project"" where students write a message on a pot using no letters or numbers so that another student can play archaeologist and decode the pot.  They put a lot of care into it over days.  I have them store their pot in a brown paper bag.  When they're done, I get ready to redistribute the bags.  I pick up a bag and then surprise them by hitting the bag with a hammer.  They freak out, but then I reveal that the bag was mine and was just pieces of an old pot.  Then I reveal the student's pot unharmed.  I put it back in the bag and get ready to hand it out but at the last second, I smash it with the hammer. I then smash the rest.  The lesson is that it's hard to decode the past because of language and culture but also because we have to find the pieces.

"I wrote a short article about a fictional nation’s famine, exacerbated by conflict between the country’s two ethnic groups. One controls the farmland, the other, the military.

I have students read with a partner, underlining important parts. Then they take a survey asking who was more responsible, from which ethnic group would they be more likely to make a friend, what adjectives would they use to describe each group, etc.

Unbeknownst to them, there are two versions of the article. They tell the same story, have the same facts, but they use dehumanizing and belittling language to describe one or the other group.

After they’ve taken the survey, I partner them with someone who read the other article, and together they reread and highlight any differences they see. It blows their fucking minds.

We talk about how the language may have affected their thoughts and feelings about these people, and then we look at the survey data. *It’s striking.* Kids don’t trust people from the demonized group. They blame them for the famine. They call them cowards. They call “their own” ethnic group brave and generous.

And every year, there are a couple kids who reserve judgment on the survey, and who explain both sides are responsible, and that the ethnic conflict is pointless.

It makes for a fantastic fifth grade conversation. I’m so happy to share materials if you want.",,,,NerdyKirdahy,,,1512918198,t5_2w9jj,t3_7iql8v,t3_7iql8v,9,1514551759,0,0,dr1euif,teachingresources,,,

"Hello, this is updated version of the video I posted last year.
[Original] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQDyn04vtf8)

New video shows most recent makeup of senate including victory of 
Doug Jones in Alabama.

***Short info:***

This is I created timelapse showing history of USA Senate, how they swithed from party to party from 1789 till 2018. For this project I decided to split all states into two parts to show both of two seats each state have. I find this method more useful than using stripes ar mixed color (aka purple for dem/gop) in times when state senators were from different parties, also this way I could show the history of each individual seat so I put numbers denoting which senate classes seats belong to.

If you dont know senate classes are for determining when particular senator face re-election. All classes have re-elections two years apart or put it other way one third of senate is elected every two years.

This video also show senate vacancies, but only long ones (nearly a year, years), vacancies that only lasted days, weeks or a few months arent shown due to timeframe of my video being one year althrought there were many of them in almost all states.

I also added names of serving presidents, vice presidents and speakers of the house in each frame. Senate majority leaders only appear 1920s because that title didnt exist before 1920s.

"Hello, this video is my most recent update on my government history videos, it shows most recent makeup of state governorships up to 2018

***Another video about USA government***

[Political evolution of USA senate 1789 - 2018] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr55ymBn9Jc)

***Short info:***

This is timelapse showing history of USA state governors, how they swithed from party to party from 1775 till 2018. 

I also added names of serving presidents, vice presidents and speakers of the house in each frame. Senate majority leaders only appear 1920s because that title didnt exist before 1920s. At the begining I also added Presidents of continental congress.

"I go with my inner score card every time, and my inner scorecard is based on consistent findings in educational research and my students' measurable results.

Consistent educational findings do not find that project-based learning is more effective for skill MASTERY and knowledge. So, I'm with you there. I favour a direct instruction approach with lots of spaced practice, feedback, and challenge, because these elements are shown most effective by research.

Finally, I assess my teaching at the end of the year when I compare my students' writing samples with their writing from the beginning of the year. I should see a big change. When I do, I know I've done well. It doesn't matter what the latest educational fads are saying; I know I've done well.

Maybe I'm just inside of the wrong subscriptions and there are specific subscriptions I should be posting in, I don't have any idea. I merely followed what a handful of my teacher friends told me to do and which subscriptions to post in, so I did.

I apologize for making that assumption. And just because I haven't contributed in my first 24 hours on Reddit doesn't mean I wasn't going to contribute. I had never even heard of this place before, so clearly it's going to take me more than 24 hours to learn how to use it in other ways. I started using it in ways I was told that it was used for. I would really like to but I've received so much hatred in the first day that I never want to come back. 

With the exception of one person, instead of anybody just trying to say ""Hey, you actually can't post donations just FYI"" in a nice mature way, I instead got called names and banned.

"If you are looking to teach coding and robotics without getting too involved in the constructing of the robot I recommend checking out CoderZ.

"I am an elementary teacher with lots of experience in teaching coding and robotics to primary years, but my opinion might be  of some use. Even for middle school, I still think Scratch is the best way to start. It’s free, can help build good initial “coding”/computational problem solving, and very accessible. For actual line by line coding, I recommend [CodeCombat](https://codecombat.com/).  It's a problem solving RPG where users have to code the solutions to different dungeons using real code in Javascript, Python, Clojure, Lua, Io, or CoffeeScript.  There are some fun gamification elements that some students enjoy.  To be honest, I've had mixed experiences using it in class, but it is a cool way to actually get the students writing real lines of code (not really whole programs). I haven’t used it in a few years so there’s a chance it’s different/paid now. 

If you are interested in a robotics application, I would highly recommend [mBOts by Makeblock](http://www.makeblock.com/product/mbot-robot-kit).
 Lego EVO is an option, which with the Lego brand allows some great building possibilities, but the native coding platform of the Lego system is TERRIBLE (IMO). I know you can reset the firmware to use Scratch or other options tho. On top of that the Lego sets are WAY too expensive.

mBot is super cheap (less than 100 USD) and uses scratch as its programing platform.  In my experience with using Lego (Mindstorms) and mBot, the students get too caught up in the building of Mindstorms (the basic Lego bot model is fairly complicated for young learners) and end up not spending much time actually programming.  mBot is pretty simple to put together and you can actually focus on the programming aspect.  Lego has nicer pieces, but because Makeblock is Arduino based, the variety of modules and possibilities makes it a better choice IMO. They make newer versions of the mbot with faster processing and more sensor/motor options. ",,,,OsakaB,,,1518056008,t5_2w9jj,t3_7w18sf,t3_7w18sf,1,1519035373,0,0,dtwsefr,teachingresources,,,
"Thank you for your input. I have used CodeCombat myself when exploring things that are out there. I did like it. I thought it was a neat program and a bit bet than Code.org since you actually have to type the code instead of just click blocks together. Though Code.org is great for the elementary students.

I saw the mBots and they looked great. Was not sure if they would be good for middle school. But If your telling me they are easy to build then, students can spend more time programing them.",,,,The_2nd,,,1518058250,t5_2w9jj,t3_7w18sf,t1_dtwsefr,1,1519036337,0,0,dtwufi2,teachingresources,,,

It's also difficult for me to decide what levels are appropriate for different grades, what ro cover when and to create a consistent slope of increasing difficulty/learning.

None of the learners know touch typing (Which I regard as a very valuable skill), but it is also time consuming to teach and difficult to assess. Thus I have not started it yet. This is further complicated by the fact that the lab does not have internet access, and I need to format all the machines. I only teach each class for one hour a week.

"I'd say go for the classic starter/main/plenary format which can totally work in a short time span.

Starter can just be a quick question or teaser to get them in the right mindset, maybe about a misconception about shelters? What do they think a shelter does etc

Main would be the bulk of the time but I can't think of an idea off the top of my head. Maybe a roleplay? 

Plenary is just an exit question or something to make them reflect on what they learnt.

"Oh, wow!  I used to read Game Informer when I was in high school, used to have a bunch of issues that were sub-#100.  Never realized GI took an interest in board gaming too!

I received my Masters in Deaf Education and spent some of my time in a couple of classes doing research in educational board games (combining two of my interests, win-win!)

I know that in today's board gaming world, Milton-Bradley, Hasbro, Parker Brothers, and the like are looked down upon, but one of these games really sticks out in Deaf Education and early childhood education - **Guess Who?**  When played/modeled by adults, it shows children and those developing a new language (at any age) how to ask questions using descriptors.  When I did my student teaching, I had an opportunity to try this out with a deaf sibling duo (one in kindergarten and one in 3rd grade) that both used cochlear implants.  They both were able to code switch between ASL and spoken English.  The goal was to develop their own set of questions in either language.  We all played about 20 minutes a day and by the end of the week, they had developed a solid understanding of the kinds of questions to ask when trying to describe someone.  Unfortunately, my internship ended before I could try and apply this to the real world, but their teacher kept in touch with me and mentioned the times that they've asked questions in conversation in relation to strangers.

Anyway, other games I've found that have educational value (I actually teach a board game enrichment course at a school for the deaf):

* Fluxx (lots of reading and retaining rules throughout)
* Dixit (have to be able to manipulate words abstractly; very minimalist)
* Timeline (you've already established this; it makes for a great visual historical timeline that can be mismashed)
* Great Western Trail (probably better played at home due to length, but from what I understand after moving to Texas, this is a pretty accurate concept of the cattle trade in Texas/Kansas City)
* Sagrada (probably more logical than mathematical, but it teaches good number sense)

These are just off the top of my head.  :)  Great article, I'll have to be sure to pick up Prime Club for my math class!",,,,caekles,,,1522123184,t5_2w9jj,t3_87angb,t3_87angb,1,1525631203,0,0,dwci641,teachingresources,,,

"Taking issue with a ton of points you make here...

You're only referencing a few articles that cite each other for the reasoning for homework - while ignoring alternative research that suggests otherwise (and, notably your sources agree that this is a practice those who don't assign homework are guilty of.)

Explicitly however:
""Apart from developing content knowledge, homework develops character. A work ethic, resilience, personal responsibility, and time-management– they’re not educational buzz words. But they matter.""
The idea that students are developing a work ethic from doing mindless 30 minute homework (to cram your content knowledge in, as stated in your writing) is a disservice to your students. Students are more than capable of developing work ethic for things THEY care about.

""Students with low socio-economic backgrounds or crappy home lives don’t need excuses or pity. They need homework. They need the skills and knowledge homework gives. Otherwise, sooner or later, they taste the dust.""
Actually, research shows that students who are from lower socio-economic backgrounds do NOT need homework. Unless your homework is simply reading (for a student's benefit, not your class) - then this argument makes no sense.

""Homework gives me feedback on my teaching. If I don’t assign homework, how do I know if the students understand? I don’t. At best, I guess.""
In class?

""The homework should be worth some kind of grade, formative or summative. Once in a while, the grade shows up in the gradebook. It keeps students on their toes. And, truth be told, most students need a carrot. It’s the answer to: “What’s in it for me?” I hate the question, because we’re talking about education, but we have to face it.""
I wasn't going to comment on this blog at all until I saw this statement. It's overwhelming that you have the audacity to make this claim given everything else that's written. If homework is explicitly important and worthwhile, then students wouldn't do it? This goes against everything else you've stated. The carrot is the fact that what you made is IMPORTANT. Students do important work when it matters. This entire resources implies: ""Children don't know what's best for them - they can't learn on their own - they'll fall behind without me!"" instead of embracing students as people who WANT to learn.

""Homework should not be excessive. 30 minutes at most per night is reasonable for my grade nines. Some days, I have nothing worthwhile to assign them, so I don’t.""
30 minutes per night PER class is a ton of homework.

"**The Hot Zone**

The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story is a best-selling 1995 nonfiction thriller by Richard Preston about the origins and incidents involving viral hemorrhagic fevers, particularly ebolaviruses and marburgviruses. The basis of the book was Preston's 1992 New Yorker article ""Crisis in the Hot Zone"".

The filoviruses, Ebola virus, Sudan virus, Marburg virus, and Ravn virus, are Biosafety Level 4 agents. Biosafety Level 4 agents are extremely dangerous to humans because they are very infectious, have a high case-fatality rate, and there are no known prophylactics, treatments, or cures.

"1-7. YES!

AND

(Numbering won’t let me start at #8 despite what I type)

8. Draft better strategies for maintaining psychological and social health. Be intentional.
9. Get more exercise and be very intentional about it; set a routine.
10. Read work from a solid life like Brendon B. There’s always something one can legitimately take away from such training, even if it’s hyped.
11. Find a way to delegate (and possibly delegate to students; if they have more ownership, they may be more engaged anyway).
12. Start identifying people you want to have as growth friends next year. People who will uplift you and hold you accountable.
13. Find specific ways to wind down—see #9, or a hobby, or meditation, etc. many of these seem overwhelming but when I started mapping my daily schedule by hour, I discovered all kinds of previously wasted time that I could repurpose to my benefit. 
14. Consider that it could be worse. We are living in one of the most amazing times in human history! And we are alive and metacognitive. We exist as opposed to there being a void. How damn cool is that? I mean,  life’s worries do get put into their place when you consider the grandness of the pale blue dot.

"Oh man. I’m so glad I can share this. You need to check out Schoology. It has both an app and website. It’s 100% free to use.

I like G Classroom too but agree that for more involved or higher level classes it just doesn’t work well. My AP course started with it this semester but we switched to Schoology and I will never go back. And I damn sure won’t use Canvas either. I hate that crap no matter how hard my county pushes it. I don’t get why admin and higher ups push things that aren’t user friendly and cost a ton of money when there are perfectly designed sites free of charge. 

That said, I have NOTHING negative to say about Schoology...yet. I’ve only been on it for about 5 months now but I let a co-worker into my class as an admin to poke around and she’s swearing off Classroom and Canvas too and another AP teacher wants to try it for next year.

Discussion is a huge thing in my AP class as well and I offer discussion forums so shy students can add in too. In Schoology you can make as many of your forums as you want. I put a new board under each unit to stay organized. Their in-site apps are amazing too. You can embed videos in your class straight from YouTube or Vimeo, connect it to your Drive so you can pull docs and such straight from it, back channel chats, pull material from Khan Academy, Evernote, etc. The iOS versions let you add a “add to Schoology” button to your browser to maximize productivity. They also have a ton of public resources from other teachers you can download and use in your class. 

As far as assignments, they can submit just like they do in Classroom. They need to add the Google Drive resource app but once they do, the submission process is nearly identical to Classroom’s. You can also edit to lock assignments so there can be no late submissions. Per the grading aspect, you can open their files and you can highlight, annotate, leave notes, etc right on their documents. You can also do module like things where they have to “complete” materials. It has its own gradebook too but I’m paranoid and keep a paper gradebook in addition to PowerSchool. 

It reminds me a lot of platforms I used in college like Moodle and Blackboard. Don’t know if you have used those or not. 

Anyway. I highly recommend it. I think I will only use Classroom for my really low kids but Schoology for everyone else. 

Edit: To address your concern about direct questions to you, they can message you through Schoology which will notif you via email. You can have a private discussion with them through the site. Class wide posts from you are shown as updates and everyone can see them. But if a student had a question they could message you only. You can also separate students into grading groups. My professor did this in college and each group would get different assignments or messages.

Very cool. It looks great.

I love this! I think it would be interesting if the students took a personality test or something and then were able to be sorted into groups based on which personality types work best together.

In an ideal world, yes, upperclassmen should know who they can and can't sit with in order to be productive, but that's not what happens. Teenagers only have so much maturity and it only extends so far. At the point that the kids are using this tool, if the teacher is putting specific blocks in place, the teacher should already have spoken to all students involved and they should know why they are there. In your vision, that conversation will prevent them from choosing someone they've been spoken to about not sitting with, in reality, they might listen or they might not. The teacher block is there to reinforce social lessons that have already been taught and to keep the kids on the right path. Not to mention, you say this isnt made for that, but if it's a tool to create ideal working groups in the classroom, but a teacher needs to go in and tweak them all afterwards to move certain students apart because they didn't listen and chose all their friends they don't work well with, then it's not a useful tool.

"Keep being honest! 

Any place that asks you what kind of teacher you are... is unfair. You're a new teacher. I don't think you can know for certain what kind of teacher you are. It's also highly dependent on how your group are, what subject you are teaching, whether the group have an assessment coming up, whether it's a full moon or Saturn is aligned...

Your teaching style will also change to align with the ethos of your school and department. 

I would ensure you mention about ""asking for help if needed"" - as that's a big one for a new teacher. Showing you are willing to ask for support.

When I'm asked about my core values, I always bring this quote in. It sits on my desk and, to me, represents the main principle I had on going in to teaching - and I still revert back to after 3 years in the classroom.

&gt;“I am a survivor of a concentration camp. My eyes saw what no person should witness: gas chambers built by learned engineers. Children poisoned by educated physicians. Infants killed by trained nurses. Women and babies shot by high school and college graduates. So, I am suspicious of education.

&gt;My request is:

&gt;Help your children become human. Your efforts must never produce learned monsters, skilled psychopaths or educated Eichmanns. Reading, writing, and arithmetic are important only if they serve to make our children more human.”

&gt;*– An excerpt of a letter written by a Holocaust survivor to educators, published in “Teacher and Child” by Dr. Haim Ginott, child psychologist and author*

To me, I'm a teacher who helps make students more human and members of a community. Results and academics work alongside that, but if they're human and want to contribute to a society, then they'll put the effort in, because they realise that education is the pathway to that. So, it works in tandem anyway.

If they didn't want your personal story, then they shouldn't have asked so broad a question. You want to be able to communicate with your future bosses, and their inability to communicate even a simple question to you is a good sign that it's not the best fit. 

When I was asked that question, I was brutally honest. I told them the real reason I was there, my biggest fears, and even that I had never dreamed of being a teacher. I see it as a road to being a professor in the future. 
I was hired.

It's important to be honest and to be YOU because no one else is going to be you. Don't take it personally if they reject that. 

Remember, you could be the prettiest, tastiest peach on the tree- but some people just don't like peaches. 

Good luck =)

"Boom! Congrats! Let the games begin! Teacher training programs paint a 'sunshine and lollipops' picture which can be disillusioning if you're not properly briefed. Be prepared to work excessive, unpaid overtime including weekends; remember you're a social worker, nurse, psychologist, entertainer, DIY handyperson, administrator, technology troubleshooter, dietician, public relations officer and life coach. In amongst all that you get to teach the next generation too.  Beware of parents...always... and remember, it's the profession that begets all others!

"As a teacher of really tough kids in a really tough context, this shirt scares me.  What other methods of evaluation are you supporting?  There are two issues which obscure the discussion: a teacher's value as an individual versus a teacher's value as a teacher.  Some teachers, possibly even me, SUCK at what they do.  How does your t-shirt get rid of them?

"1. How do standard test results definitively indicate the quality of the teacher's practice? 
2. Is it possible to teach specifically to answer test questions and get decent results and yet be an ineffective teacher in the bigger picture? 
3. Do you believe in exogenic factors can impact a cohort/class/year/school responses to standardised test results? 

&gt; It's easy to say what's wrong with the world if you're not supplying any solutions.

I do not need to have the answer for solving gun violence in American schools to argue against the idea of arming teachers.  Likewise, I do not need to have the answer for understanding teaching quality to argue against the idea that standardised test results do not effectively measure it. 

&gt; What is your replacement for standardized testing?

Moderation. 

Internal Moderation: Executive Teaching staff observe and review Teaching Practice at schools and provide those reviews to External Moderation. 

External Moderation: Submit examples of students work, (A students and C students) and teachers of similar specialisations can review the assessments and results of assessments compared to your grade descriptors. Portfolio Items should also include some core examples of Teaching and Learning practices to provide additional weighting from your Internal Moderation Review. External Moderators provide feedback to improve the class, highlight ""teacher that suck"", and validate that the quality of work coming out of a class is of satisfactory level.

"&gt; They do not.

Then they do nothing to ""get rid of teachers who suck"". 

&gt; ""Bigger picture"" can be dangerously non-specific.

Specifically, can you teach well enough to get kids to do well enough at a test but be a poor teacher for anything that isn't measured on a test, like real synthesis and interdisciplinary application?

If you believe that the answer is yes then you would agree that standardised testing can help entrench ""teachers who suck"" and potentially remove teachers who don't 'suck"". 

&gt; Do you believe in exogenic factors can impact a cohort/class/year/school responses to standardised test results?

Then you agree that standardised tests aren't a reliable measurement of learning. 

This means that standardised testing doesn't help us understand the quality of teaching or learning that occurs in any classroom. So, why even have it in the first place.
